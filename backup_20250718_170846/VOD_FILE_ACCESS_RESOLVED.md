# VOD File Access Limitation - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Overview

This document summarizes the resolution of the VOD file access limitation that was identified in the Archivist system.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED**  
**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Implementation:** Enhanced VOD processing with local file prioritization

## Original Problem

### ‚ùå **VOD File Access from Cablecast** - LIMITED ACCESS
**Issue:** VOD files are not directly accessible via API endpoints
- **Root Cause:** Cablecast system stores VODs in a format that doesn't expose direct download URLs
- **Impact:** Cannot download actual video files for processing
- **Scope:** All VODs in the system (50+ VODs checked)

## Solution Implemented

### ‚úÖ **Local File Access from Mounted Drives** - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Approach:** Prioritize local file access from mounted flex servers over downloading from Cablecast API URLs.

#### Key Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced File Path Resolution** (`core/tasks/vod_processing.py`)
   - Updated `get_vod_file_path()` function to prioritize local file access
   - Added comprehensive search through all flex server mounts
   - Implemented intelligent file matching by VOD ID, title, and patterns
   - Added fallback to API download only if local file not found

2. **Improved VOD Discovery** (`core/tasks/vod_processing.py`)
   - Enhanced `get_recent_vods_from_flex_server()` function
   - Added mount point validation and accessibility checks
   - Implemented recursive file search through common video directories
   - Added file size filtering to skip non-video files

3. **Updated Processing Workflow** (`core/tasks/vod_processing.py`)
   - Modified `process_single_vod()` to prioritize local file access
   - Added local file search before attempting API calls
   - Implemented graceful fallback to API when local files not found

## Technical Implementation

### File Search Strategy

The system now searches for VOD files in the following order:

1. **Direct File Path:** If provided, use immediately
2. **Mounted Drive Search:** Scan all flex server mounts
3. **Pattern Matching:** Look for files by VOD ID, title, or common patterns
4. **Recursive Search:** Search through common video directories
5. **API Fallback:** Only attempt API download if local file not found

### Mount Point Integration

```python
# Search through all flex server mounts
for city_id, city_config in MEMBER_CITIES.items():
    mount_path = city_config.get('mount_path', f'/mnt/{city_id}')
    if mount_path and os.path.ismount(mount_path):
        # Search for VOD files in common directories
        vod_dirs = [
            os.path.join(mount_path, 'videos'),
            os.path.join(mount_path, 'vod_content'),
            os.path.join(mount_path, 'city_council'),
            os.path.join(mount_path, 'meetings'),
            os.path.join(mount_path, 'content'),
            mount_path  # Root directory
        ]
```

### File Pattern Matching

```python
# Look for files that might match this VOD
possible_files = [
    f"{vod_id}.mp4",
    f"{vod_id}.mov",
    f"{vod_id}.avi",
    f"{vod_id}.mkv",
    f"vod_{vod_id}.mp4",
    f"VOD_{vod_id}.mp4"
]

# Also check for files with title-based names
title = vod_data.get('title', '').replace(' ', '_').replace('/', '_')
if title:
    possible_files.extend([
        f"{title}.mp4",
        f"{title}.mov",
        f"{title}.avi",
        f"{title}.mkv"
    ])
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Performance Improvements**
- **No Download Overhead:** Direct file access eliminates download time
- **Faster Processing:** Immediate access to video files
- **Reduced Bandwidth:** No need to download large video files
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple files can be processed simultaneously

### 2. **Reliability Enhancements**
- **No API Dependency:** Works independently of Cablecast API availability
- **Offline Capability:** Can process files even when API is unavailable
- **Error Resilience:** Graceful handling of file access issues
- **Consistent Access:** Direct file system access is more reliable

### 3. **Operational Benefits**
- **Reduced Complexity:** Simpler file access without API integration
- **Better Monitoring:** Direct file system monitoring capabilities
- **Easier Debugging:** File access issues are easier to diagnose
- **Cost Reduction:** No bandwidth costs for file downloads

### 4. **Scalability Improvements**
- **Local Processing:** All processing happens on local infrastructure
- **No External Dependencies:** Reduced external service dependencies
- **Flexible Storage:** Can work with any mounted storage system
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easy to add new mount points

## Usage Examples

### 1. Processing a Local VOD File

```python
from core.tasks.vod_processing import process_single_vod

# Process a file directly from mounted drive
result = process_single_vod.delay(
    vod_id="flex_flex1_001",
    city_id="flex1",
    video_path="/mnt/flex-1/videos/city_council_meeting.mp4"
)
```

### 2. Discovering VODs on Flex Servers

```python
from core.tasks.vod_processing import get_recent_vods_from_flex_server

# Get recent VODs from a specific flex server
vods = get_recent_vods_from_flex_server(
    mount_path="/mnt/flex-1",
    city_id="flex1",
    limit=10
)

for vod in vods:
    print(f"Found VOD: {vod['title']} at {vod['file_path']}")
```

### 3. Batch Processing All Cities

```python
from core.tasks.vod_processing import process_recent_vods

# Process VODs for all member cities
result = process_recent_vods.delay()
```

## Configuration

### Member Cities Configuration

The system uses the existing `MEMBER_CITIES` configuration:

```python
MEMBER_CITIES = {
    'flex1': {
        'name': 'Birchwood',
        'mount_path': '/mnt/flex-1',
        'patterns': ['birchwood', 'birch wood', 'birchwood city']
    },
    'flex2': {
        'name': 'Dellwood/Grant/Willernie',
        'mount_path': '/mnt/flex-2',
        'patterns': ['dellwood', 'grant', 'willernie']
    },
    # ... other cities
}
```

### Mount Point Requirements

Each flex server mount must be:
- **Mounted:** Available as a mount point
- **Readable:** Accessible for file reading
- **Stable:** Consistently available during processing

## Monitoring and Logging

### Enhanced Logging

The system provides detailed logging for file discovery:

```python
logger.info(f"Found VOD file on mounted drive: {file_path}")
logger.info(f"Using local VOD file: {path}")
logger.warning(f"No VOD file found for VOD {vod_id} on any mounted drive")
```

### File Access Metrics

The system tracks:
- **Files Found:** Number of VOD files discovered on each mount
- **Access Success Rate:** Percentage of successful file accesses
- **Processing Time:** Time to find and access files
- **Error Rates:** File access failure rates

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Tests

The enhanced functionality includes comprehensive testing:
- **File Discovery Tests:** Verify file finding on mounted drives
- **Pattern Matching Tests:** Test file matching algorithms
- **Fallback Tests:** Verify API fallback when local files not found
- **Error Handling Tests:** Test graceful error handling

### Integration Tests

- **Mount Point Tests:** Verify mount point accessibility
- **File Access Tests:** Test file reading capabilities
- **Processing Pipeline Tests:** End-to-end processing tests
- **Performance Tests:** Measure processing speed improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Mount Point Not Accessible
```bash
# Check if mount point is mounted
mount | grep flex

# Check mount point permissions
ls -la /mnt/flex-1
```

#### 2. Files Not Found
```bash
# Check if video files exist
find /mnt/flex-1 -name "*.mp4" -type f

# Check file permissions
ls -la /mnt/flex-1/videos/
```

#### 3. Processing Failures
```python
# Check file accessibility
import os
file_path = "/mnt/flex-1/videos/example.mp4"
print(f"File exists: {os.path.exists(file_path)}")
print(f"File readable: {os.access(file_path, os.R_OK)}")
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed file discovery:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('core.tasks.vod_processing').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements
