# Health Check System Status

**Generated**: 2025-08-05 15:08 UTC  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL - AUTOMATED MONITORING ACTIVE**

## üéØ **HEALTH CHECK SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

The Archivist VOD system now has comprehensive automated health monitoring that runs every hour via Celery beat scheduler. The system monitors all critical components including storage, API connectivity, and system resources.

## ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**

### **Core Health Check Components**
- **Storage Health Checker**: Monitors all flex mounts and temp directories
- **API Health Checker**: Tests Cablecast API connectivity with circuit breaker
- **System Health Checker**: Monitors CPU, memory, disk usage, and Celery workers
- **Health Check Manager**: Orchestrates all checks and provides unified results

### **Automated Scheduling**
- **Scheduled Task**: `health_checks.run_scheduled_health_check` runs every hour
- **Individual Tasks**: Separate tasks for storage, API, and system checks
- **Celery Integration**: Fully integrated with existing Celery infrastructure
- **Metrics Collection**: All health checks feed into the metrics system

### **Current System Status** (2025-08-05 15:08 UTC)
```
Overall Status: DEGRADED (4 degraded, 0 unhealthy)
Total Checks: 13
Healthy: 9 components
Degraded: 4 components (storage write permissions)
Unhealthy: 0 components
Response Time: 0.37 seconds
```

## üìä **DETAILED HEALTH STATUS**

### **Storage Health** (10 checks)
- ‚úÖ **Healthy (6)**: `/mnt/flex-1`, `/mnt/flex-5`, `/mnt/flex-6`, `/mnt/flex-8`, `/mnt/flex-9`, `/tmp`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Degraded (4)**: `/mnt/flex-2`, `/mnt/flex-3`, `/mnt/flex-4`, `/mnt/flex-7`
  - **Issue**: Mounted and writable but write test failed due to permission restrictions
  - **Impact**: Minimal - storage is accessible but some write operations may be restricted

### **API Health** (1 check)
- ‚úÖ **Healthy**: Cablecast API
  - **Response Time**: 0.14 seconds
  - **Circuit Breaker**: CLOSED (normal operation)
  - **Status**: Responding normally

### **System Resources** (2 checks)
- ‚úÖ **Healthy**: System resources
  - **CPU Usage**: 7.5% (normal)
  - **Memory Usage**: 18.8% (normal)
  - **Disk Usage**: 2.6% (excellent)
  - **Available Memory**: 57.4 GB
  - **Available Disk**: 3.17 TB

- ‚úÖ **Healthy**: Celery workers
  - **Active Workers**: 5 processes
  - **Status**: All workers running normally
  - **Queues**: vod_processing, default

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Health Check Tasks**
```python
# Main scheduled task (runs every hour)
health_checks.run_scheduled_health_check

# Individual component tasks
health_checks.run_storage_check
health_checks.run_api_check  
health_checks.run_system_check
```

### **Health Check Logic**
- **Storage**: Mount availability, write permissions, free space
- **API**: Connection testing with circuit breaker protection
- **System**: Resource monitoring, process detection
- **Celery**: Worker process detection and status

### **Integration Points**
- **Celery Scheduler**: Hourly automated execution
- **Metrics System**: Health data feeds into monitoring
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all health events
- **Dashboard**: Health status available via monitoring dashboard

## üö® **ALERTING & MONITORING**

### **Status Levels**
- **Healthy**: Component operating normally
- **Degraded**: Component has issues but still functional
- **Unhealthy**: Component failed or unavailable

### **Automated Responses**
- **Logging**: All health check results logged with appropriate levels
- **Metrics**: Health status tracked in metrics system
- **Scheduling**: Failed checks don't prevent future scheduled runs
- **Recovery**: System continues operating even with degraded components

## üìà **PERFORMANCE METRICS**

### **Health Check Performance**
- **Average Response Time**: 0.37 seconds
- **Storage Checks**: 0.01-0.84 seconds per mount
- **API Checks**: 0.13-0.21 seconds
- **System Checks**: <0.1 seconds

### **Resource Usage**
- **CPU Impact**: Minimal (<1% during checks)
- **Memory Impact**: Negligible
- **Storage Impact**: Temporary test files (auto-cleaned)

## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Storage Write Test Failures**
```bash
# Check mount permissions
ls -la /mnt/flex-*

# Check mount status
mount | grep flex

# Test write access manually
touch /mnt/flex-X/test_file && rm /mnt/flex-X/test_file
```

#### **API Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check network connectivity
ping cablecast-server

# Test API manually
curl -u username:password https://cablecast-server/api/status
```

#### **Celery Worker Issues**
```bash
# Check worker processes
ps aux | grep celery | grep worker

# Check Celery status
celery -A core.tasks inspect active
```

### **Health Check Commands**
```bash
# Run health check manually
python3 -c "from core.monitoring.health_checks import get_health_manager; manager = get_health_manager(); result = manager.run_all_health_checks(); print(result)"

# Trigger scheduled health check
python3 -c "from core.tasks.health_checks import run_scheduled_health_check; result = run_scheduled_health_check.delay(); print(f'Task ID: {result.id}')"

# Check health check logs
tail -f /opt/Archivist/logs/archivist.log | grep health
```

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Actions**
- **Monitor**: Watch for any unhealthy status changes
- **Investigate**: Storage permission issues on flex-2,3,4,7 mounts
- **Optimize**: Consider adjusting health check frequency if needed

### **Future Enhancements**
- **Alerting**: Add email/SMS alerts for unhealthy status
- **Dashboard**: Enhanced health visualization in monitoring dashboard
- **Metrics**: Historical health trend analysis
- **Auto-recovery**: Automatic restart of failed components

## ‚úÖ **CONCLUSION**

The automated health check system is **fully operational** and providing comprehensive monitoring of all system components. The system is currently in a **degraded** state due to storage write permission restrictions on some mounts, but all critical functionality remains operational.

**Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Automated health monitoring every hour
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive component coverage
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing Celery infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging and metrics collection
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation handling
- ‚úÖ Real-time status monitoring

The health check system is now a critical component of the Archivist VOD infrastructure, providing early warning of potential issues and ensuring system reliability.
