# Celery Task Management Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced Celery task management capabilities implemented in the Archivist system to overcome the inherent limitations of Celery's native task management features.

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-17  
**Implementation:** Enhanced UnifiedQueueManager with Redis-backed state persistence

## Previous Limitations

The original implementation had three main limitations:

1. **Task Resuming** - Celery doesn't natively support resuming paused/failed tasks
2. **Task Reordering** - Celery doesn't provide built-in task reordering capabilities  
3. **Failed Task Cleanup** - Limited cleanup functionality with no retention policies

## Enhanced Solutions

### 1. Task Resuming Implementation ✅

**Problem:** Celery doesn't support resuming tasks natively.

**Solution:** Task recreation with state preservation using Redis.

#### How It Works:

```python
def resume_task(self, task_id: str) -> bool:
    """Resume a paused or failed task by recreating it with preserved state."""
```

**Process:**
1. **State Retrieval:** Get original task state from Redis
2. **Validation:** Check if task is in a resumable state
3. **Task Recreation:** Create new task with same parameters
4. **Progress Transfer:** Preserve any intermediate results
5. **Cleanup:** Remove old task and state

#### Features:
- ✅ **State Preservation:** Saves task parameters, progress, and intermediate results
- ✅ **Smart Validation:** Only allows resuming of appropriate task states
- ✅ **Progress Transfer:** Maintains work progress across task recreation
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup:** Removes old task instances and state

#### Usage Example:
```python
# Resume a failed transcription task
queue_manager = get_unified_queue_manager()
success = queue_manager.resume_task("failed-task-id")
if success:
    print("Task resumed successfully")
```

### 2. Task Reordering Implementation ✅

**Problem:** Celery doesn't provide native task reordering.

**Solution:** Priority-based queue management with Redis-backed priority tracking.

#### How It Works:

```python
def reorder_task(self, task_id: str, position: int) -> bool:
    """Reorder a task by adjusting its priority."""
```

**Process:**
1. **Priority Calculation:** Convert position to priority value (0-100)
2. **State Validation:** Ensure task is in reorderable state
3. **Priority Assignment:** Store priority in Redis with TTL
4. **Queue Rebalancing:** Adjust priorities of all pending tasks
5. **Order Maintenance:** Sort tasks by priority for execution

#### Features:
- ✅ **Position-Based Priority:** Position 0 = highest priority
- ✅ **State Validation:** Only allows reordering of pending/retry tasks
- ✅ **Queue Rebalancing:** Maintains relative order of all tasks
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup:** Priority entries expire after 24 hours

#### Usage Example:
```python
# Move task to front of queue (position 0)
queue_manager = get_unified_queue_manager()
success = queue_manager.reorder_task("task-id", 0)
if success:
    print("Task moved to front of queue")
```

### 3. Failed Task Cleanup Implementation ✅

**Problem:** Limited cleanup functionality with no retention policies.

**Solution:** Comprehensive cleanup with configurable retention policies and temporary file management.

#### How It Works:

```python
def cleanup_failed_tasks(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Clean up failed Celery tasks with configurable retention policies."""
```

**Process:**
1. **Retention Policies:** Apply different cleanup periods by task type
2. **State Cleanup:** Remove old task state entries from Redis
3. **Priority Cleanup:** Clean up expired priority entries
4. **Temp File Cleanup:** Remove temporary files from failed tasks
5. **Statistics Reporting:** Provide detailed cleanup statistics

#### Retention Policies:
```python
retention_policies = {
    'transcription': 24,      # Keep transcription failures for 24 hours
    'vod_processing': 48,     # Keep VOD processing failures for 48 hours
    'default': 12             # Default retention for other tasks
}
```

#### Features:
- ✅ **Configurable Retention:** Different cleanup periods by task type
- ✅ **State Management:** Automatic cleanup of Redis state entries
- ✅ **Temp File Cleanup:** Removes temporary files from failed tasks
- ✅ **Detailed Statistics:** Comprehensive cleanup reporting
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of cleanup errors

#### Usage Example:
```python
# Clean up failed tasks
queue_manager = get_unified_queue_manager()
results = queue_manager.cleanup_failed_tasks()
print(f"Cleaned {results['state_cleaned']} state entries")
print(f"Cleaned {results['temp_files_cleaned']} temp files")
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Redis Data Structure

The enhanced system uses Redis for state persistence with the following key patterns:

```
archivist:task_state:{task_id}     # Task state and parameters
archivist:task_priority:{task_id}  # Task priority values
archivist:failed_tasks:{task_id}   # Failed task metadata
```

### State Persistence

Task state is automatically saved with:
- **TTL:** 1 hour for task state, 24 hours for priorities
- **JSON Format:** Structured data for easy retrieval
- **Metadata:** Timestamps, progress, and recovery information

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling ensures:
- **Graceful Degradation:** System continues working even if enhancements fail
- **Detailed Logging:** All operations are logged for debugging
- **Fallback Behavior:** Returns to original behavior on errors

## API Integration

### REST API Endpoints

The enhanced capabilities are available through existing API endpoints:

```bash
# Resume a task
POST /api/unified-queue/tasks/{task_id}/resume

# Reorder a task
POST /api/unified-queue/tasks/{task_id}/reorder
{
    "position": 0
}

# Clean up failed tasks
POST /api/unified-queue/tasks/cleanup
```

### Response Formats

#### Resume Task Response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Task resumed successfully",
    "new_task_id": "new-task-id"
}
```

#### Reorder Task Response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Task reordered successfully",
    "new_position": 0,
    "priority": 0
}
```

#### Cleanup Response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "results": {
        "tasks_cleaned": 0,
        "state_cleaned": 5,
        "temp_files_cleaned": 12,
        "errors": []
    },
    "message": "Failed tasks cleanup completed"
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging

Enhanced logging provides visibility into all operations:

```python
logger.info(f"Successfully resumed task {task_id} as {new_task.id}")
logger.info(f"Successfully reordered task {task_id} to position {position}")
logger.info(f"Failed task cleanup completed: {stats['state_cleaned']} entries")
```

### Metrics

The system tracks:
- **Resume Success Rate:** Percentage of successful task resumes
- **Reorder Operations:** Number of task reordering operations
- **Cleanup Statistics:** Detailed cleanup metrics
- **Error Rates:** Failure rates for each operation type

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Redis configuration (already configured)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Cleanup configuration
CLEANUP_RETENTION_TRANSCRIPTION=24
CLEANUP_RETENTION_VOD_PROCESSING=48
CLEANUP_RETENTION_DEFAULT=12
```

### Task State TTL

```python
# Task state expires after 1 hour
TASK_STATE_TTL = 3600

# Priority entries expire after 24 hours  
PRIORITY_TTL = 86400
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Feature

#### Task Resuming:
- ✅ **Use for:** Failed tasks with recoverable errors
- ✅ **Use for:** Paused tasks that need to continue
- ❌ **Don't use for:** Successfully completed tasks
- ❌ **Don't use for:** Tasks with unrecoverable errors

#### Task Reordering:
- ✅ **Use for:** High-priority tasks that need immediate processing
- ✅ **Use for:** Batch processing optimization
- ❌ **Don't use for:** Running tasks (will be ignored)
- ❌ **Don't use for:** Completed tasks

#### Failed Task Cleanup:
- ✅ **Use for:** Regular maintenance (daily/weekly)
- ✅ **Use for:** Disk space management
- ✅ **Use for:** System performance optimization
- ❌ **Don't use for:** Active debugging sessions

### Performance Considerations

1. **Redis Usage:** State persistence adds minimal Redis overhead
2. **Task Recreation:** Resume operations create new task instances
3. **Priority Management:** Reordering requires Redis operations
4. **Cleanup Impact:** Cleanup operations are I/O intensive

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Task Resume Fails:
```python
# Check if task state exists
state = queue_manager._get_task_state(task_id)
if not state:
    print("No saved state found for task")
```

#### Reorder Doesn't Work:
```python
# Check task status
result = celery_app.AsyncResult(task_id)
if result.status not in ['PENDING', 'RETRY']:
    print("Task not in reorderable state")
```

#### Cleanup Returns Errors:
```python
# Check Redis connectivity
try:
    redis_client.ping()
    print("Redis connection OK")
except:
    print("Redis connection failed")
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed operation tracking:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('core.unified_queue_manager').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Persistent Task Queues:** Database-backed task persistence
2. **Advanced Scheduling:** Time-based task scheduling
3. **Task Dependencies:** Task dependency management
4. **Resource Monitoring:** CPU/memory-based task prioritization
5. **Distributed Cleanup:** Multi-worker cleanup coordination

### Integration Opportunities

1. **Prometheus Metrics:** Export cleanup and operation metrics
2. **Grafana Dashboards:** Visualize task management operations
3. **Alerting:** Notify on cleanup failures or high error rates
4. **Audit Logging:** Track all task management operations
