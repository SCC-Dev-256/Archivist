1
00:00:02,616 --> 00:00:06,678
I think we should have some like introduction and music like the CBS Evening News or something.

2
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:06,998
Drum roll.

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,059
Yeah, exactly.

4
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:09,640
Okay, should we call this meeting to order?

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,961
Okay, we'll call this meeting to order.

6
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:13,602
Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

7
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:27,149
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

8
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:32,824
A nice soggy night, right?

9
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:35,545
Happy Flag Day, everybody.

10
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:37,966
Flags are out.

11
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:39,587
That's announcement number one.

12
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,048
Kevin and I just did that.

13
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:56,035
Next item is to approve the agenda, and there's, I would like to add under, instead of city attorney's report, since he won't be here, I'll add Wildwood Park discussion.

14
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:03,094
since the parade is coming up, and we need to get that taken care of.

15
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,616
Can I put a couple things more on my agenda?

16
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:13,141
I was going to update the community on Comcast, I mean on CenturyLink, sorry, and just update what happened at the planned exchange and the garage sale.

17
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:14,342
Not a problem.

18
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,125
I move the amended agenda.

19
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:19,346
Is there a second?

20
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:19,746
Second.

21
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:21,688
All those in favor?

22
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:22,508
Aye.

23
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:23,229
Opposed?

24
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:23,809
That carries.

25
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,531
Mike, you get to figure out who seconded that.

26
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:27,352
I think everybody did.

27
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:31,752
Announcements, we've got the Across the Lake Swim, July 2nd.

28
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:32,652
Gene Rooley is here.

29
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:38,314
He's gonna be the boat person with his wife, being safety conscious and all that.

30
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:39,575
7 a.m., Birch Beach.

31
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:46,837
Second item is the 4th of July Parade, which is 9.30, starting at Polly Shank's Old Place, 5 Birchwood Avenue.

32
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:52,599
Anybody who wants to volunteer, still looking for a little bit of help on that, can contact me.

33
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,920
If they don't contact me, I will be contacting somebody.

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,121
So watch out for phone calls from me.

35
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:01,524
Next item.

36
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,585
Any other announcements?

37
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:04,446
Good to go.

38
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:09,149
Next item is the city consent agenda.

39
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,750
Is there a motion to approve that?

40
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:12,431
So moved.

41
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,311
Is there a second?

42
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:13,832
Second.

43
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:14,852
All those in favor?

44
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:15,853
Aye.

45
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:16,673
That carries.

46
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:22,417
Next item is the city engineer and Steve Thatcher is here from Thatcher Engineering.

47
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,018
Oh, Mike?

48
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:27,440
Did I miss something already?

49
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:30,610
Rulie would like to.

50
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,312
Oh, sorry about that.

51
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:34,874
See, I'm always ready to rip a roll through this.

52
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:44,184
Okay, Gene, public forum, which is a another way of saying the roads committee has commandeered it for us here.

53
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:50,919
Gene Rooley, 262 Wildwood Avenue and chair of the roads.

54
00:02:51,740 --> 00:03:01,882
I think on that cross the lake swim on the birch easement, let's put a flag up or something so that the swimmers have something that's rather than a tree or something, you know.

55
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,183
It's hard to see from the peninsula, so.

56
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,259
Let's run up something, someone's bed sheet or something.

57
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,639
Randy?

58
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:09,460
I've heard that too.

59
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,242
I don't know, just someone in town who's got a flag pole.

60
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:15,644
The flag is no use, but you need a flag pole to get it up in the air, I think.

61
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:16,284
That's the key.

62
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:17,685
Well, I tell you what, we can talk about it.

63
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:20,927
I have put up something as big as four by eight.

64
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:22,208
You can't see it.

65
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:23,909
I think Randy just mentioned it.

66
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,470
Would you put up something, Randy?

67
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:26,931
I don't have any flag poles.

68
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:27,392
Bed sheet.

69
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,361
We'll find something.

70
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:30,141
We'll work on it.

71
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:30,562
We'll work on it.

72
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:31,122
Good idea.

73
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:33,184
It's in the minutes now.

74
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:33,784
It'll happen.

75
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:34,405
All right.

76
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:39,389
We had, I think, an active month with the roads and streets.

77
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,671
The things that we had to confront us, we worked on.

78
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:51,758
And weeds were mowed, and mud is still where it's supposed to be, but we're on it.

79
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:55,762
And issues that came up.

80
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:58,909
were reported to Mike or wherever we had to do it.

81
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:02,272
And I know that the signs didn't get up.

82
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:06,915
The person that is doing that didn't move it to the top of his list.

83
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:09,537
And so we'll deal with that.

84
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:14,741
But I bet you anything we'll live for another month or a few days, at least, before they get up.

85
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:16,302
And we've discussed it.

86
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:17,764
We're working on that.

87
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:24,048
On our committee of walkways and paths in the village,

88
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:26,370
We met this last week.

89
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,551
We discussed a lot of different ideas.

90
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:34,093
We didn't set our next date because we had a couple of assignments that people are on.

91
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:45,398
One was to get MnDOT to come and see if they have ideas on what would make a street that's busy a walkway.

92
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:46,298
I think we're

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,166
Cedar and Hall, maybe we're devoting too much time just on those two streets of focus for that committee.

94
00:04:55,387 --> 00:05:05,337
There's gonna be traffic there, and the street's only so wide, and so we're looking for alternatives is what we're doing, and we'll see how it comes out.

95
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:10,082
It's gonna take a while, and they're willing to work, and we'll just go from there.

96
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:14,881
I don't think we have any time frame, which we expect an answer.

97
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,063
But we do have a time frame for the stop signs.

98
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:19,644
And you and I talked today.

99
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:24,167
And I think we need to go to plan B, which is we've got two fellows who do work in the community.

100
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,408
They have tools.

101
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,589
And I think we could enlist one or both.

102
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:28,670
Maybe it's a two-person job.

103
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,173
But I think it shouldn't be hard to put up half a dozen stop signs or whatever we're doing.

104
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:42,021
I think we need to do that because I just don't think the other fellow has the time or the, I don't know, doesn't have the time right now.

105
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:43,082
Can I speak to that?

106
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:43,563
Yeah.

107
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:45,625
Okay, so there's several things that have to happen.

108
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:52,132
First is we need to have a tree service person that can clear trees and brush along the side of the road.

109
00:05:52,752 --> 00:06:01,060
We also need to contact, make marks on where they all go, contact, go for state one call, get all the product here, stay within budget, and then install them.

110
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,606
So it's not just, you know, get a shovel and go out and put some posts in the ground and hope that, you know, it all works out.

111
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:11,990
So the process being done, everything's ordered, I think everything's actually here now.

112
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:13,532
Is everything here?

113
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:20,434
I believe so, now we're waiting for tree service, and we're waiting for a bid from that still, which has been three weeks ongoing.

114
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:25,255
We're also waiting for Gulf State to come out and mark once we have the spots all designated.

115
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:31,037
So there's a lot of pretty substantial process.

116
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:35,458
But by all means, we can have anybody do it.

117
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:37,859
So there's no rocket science involved in that at all.

118
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:45,738
You know, I noticed that you folks had made sure the vegetation was cut.

119
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:53,870
I think we can go one step further and again go through with our handyman to actually clear the

120
00:06:54,491 --> 00:07:07,195
There's limbs and whatnot that you can't see the pedestrian signs, you can't see the speed signs, and everything is just like, I was gone for three weeks, and all of a sudden, boom, I come back, and a forest has grown up in three weeks.

121
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,797
So I think we need to get Jim and Greg,

122
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:27,769
out there, and that'll solve the problem that you're saying we need to, and you know, I don't think we need a bid for that, it's just an hourly, we don't need to be bogged down with an evaluation of just get out there, get it done, it shouldn't be complicated, it's all in the right of way.

123
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:43,620
I think the people in the village that work their yard all the way to the street should give some consideration, too, if there's vegetation that they want to have trimmed, that they do it themselves so that it doesn't get wiped out or something.

124
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:54,186
The big thing is that it isn't hanging over the street or obstructing or what have you, so that it looks halfway decent, too.

125
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,067
I think that's part of it.

126
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,052
Aesthetically, it should be evaluated.

127
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:04,953
Yeah, and I think the section of Hall Avenue, it's much more wild, if you will, than the section on Cedar.

128
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:08,214
There's a difference in, you know, just happens to be a natural divide.

129
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:10,095
People down in Hall, it's more natural.

130
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:14,836
So, and that's where the trees have really taken off.

131
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:21,498
I think Cedar less so, but I think we've got an obligation to make sure that signage is available right now.

132
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:24,260
with the speeds and the stop signs.

133
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,781
I think it shouldn't be hard to do.

134
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,463
It shouldn't be complicated.

135
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:36,968
Unless you folks are thinking we're trampling on somebody's expectations about how much should be left alone in their own yard.

136
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:43,133
Well, if it's a bigger tree where Steve or one of the foresters are involved, again, it's a schedule that you deal with.

137
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:49,437
It seems like they get done sooner or later.

138
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:50,458
Sometimes it's later.

139
00:08:51,394 --> 00:09:00,023
Well, Steve went and did, you know, he did the whole canopy about 18 months ago with the expectation that that was going to last more than just 18 months.

140
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:08,431
So, these are things that are just growing out like the buckthorn and the honeysuckle and these are things that are just sort of creeping to the open space to get more sun.

141
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:13,495
Box Elder, a lot of Box Elders are just gone wild.

142
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:24,002
So I have a feeling, I mean maybe we could, maybe you and I want to walk the street and say boom, boom, boom, and if there's anything that looks suspiciously nice.

143
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:30,834
we should warn Greg and Jim, but otherwise it's basically just maintenance.

144
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,954
We don't have that walk path developed yet.

145
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:34,055
How can we walk the streets?

146
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:35,855
I understand.

147
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,755
Oh, come on now.

148
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:40,576
But I think it's a safety issue.

149
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:50,017
Again, just as we clip the weeds down, we want to clip the trees down, because they're boxing people closer to the road than they want to be when they walk.

150
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:50,857
We'll take a look at it.

151
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:52,198
I think we can do that.

152
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:54,498
But I think it's a Jim and Greg kind of thing.

153
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:56,364
Does that make sense?

154
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,106
I hear I am, you know, talking too much.

155
00:09:58,126 --> 00:09:59,808
They cut down full-size trees then?

156
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:03,492
No, no, this is just a... Because the full-size trees have to go down before they can come back and brush.

157
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:08,879
It needs to be brushed back because we have stuff that, so if you, we pay them to go out and cut down small stuff.

158
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:09,460
Right, right.

159
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,921
Right on the edge of the tree.

160
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,104
Three weeks later, it's growing back over the street again.

161
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:20,669
So there's large stuff, that's why I contacted Steve, and he's our tree guy here, I think.

162
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:30,415
And then, Ken also has this big crazy mower thing, which will go through and do that once the big trees are out of the way, but you can't do one without the other, and so it's kind of a bottleneck.

163
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:37,060
And the signs, I don't see a problem with the signs being done by the end of the month, but that being said, I don't know.

164
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,240
We're in good hands.

165
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:39,341
I think it'll get done.

166
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,003
Anything else?

167
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:56,437
I do like the fact of if you see anything that looks nice on any of the properties, including the one up here on the corner of East County Line and Cedar, that we contact the homeowner, and if they don't wanna do it, then we'll take care of it, so.

168
00:10:57,168 --> 00:11:08,192
I don't know if, you know, I spoke to the owner there and he said he would do it himself and then he didn't and I hesitate to, I gave him the option.

169
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:10,233
You want me to do it or you want to do it?

170
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:14,814
He chose to do it himself and I'm a little reluctant to go cut it down.

171
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:19,216
And I don't think it's on his property, I think it's on the county.

172
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:24,818
And maybe they should move those bushes all back if they want to keep them.

173
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:29,658
Lilacs are pretty easy to move.

174
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:31,999
Easy meaning they'll probably survive if they move them.

175
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:37,320
I think that's probably something you want to just leave to have Mike do.

176
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:45,623
So it becomes a city action instead of a gene really action that causes you, you can't win.

177
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:50,725
But you can help.

178
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:52,945
Get us started in the right direction.

179
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:54,326
That part's been done.

180
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:55,486
Just got the ball rolling.

181
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:57,663
It's all good.

182
00:11:58,043 --> 00:11:58,204
Good.

183
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,224
Thank you.

184
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:00,285
Okay.

185
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:01,866
Stay dry.

186
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:06,849
Okay, Steve.

187
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,212
Sure.

188
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,092
Steve Thatcher.

189
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:16,316
We're talking about lift stations, lift station monitoring.

190
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:25,022
Since last meeting, Mike Anderson and I met with Tim Hilsham and showed him the lift stations and discussed his monitoring of the lift stations.

191
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:32,033
And Tim and two others are interested in providing monitoring services to the city.

192
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:45,257
So with Mike and your water operator's help, then we've got five people who could share the 24-7 response time of, say, 15 minutes for lift station number two.

193
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:50,278
I'm talking with Tim Hilsham and two others.

194
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,062
All of them, all those three have sewer operators licenses.

195
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,586
They are currently employed by the city of Lionel Lakes.

196
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:08,412
They have approval from their supervisor at Lionel Lakes to provide this service to the city.

197
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:25,497
as soon as the city decided to go on further with this and evaluate this, the current plan, the way I understand it, that we left it with Tim was that Berkshire Village would contract with him, the city,

198
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,988
I mean it's his company actually, not just him personally, his company.

199
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:33,871
And then the other two people would be part of his company.

200
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:39,376
So it would be a contract between the city of Birchwood Village and Tim's company.

201
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:41,418
So they wouldn't be an employee.

202
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,978
of the City of Birchwood Village.

203
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:53,885
None of it is set in stone, everything's negotiable, but it wouldn't be through the City of Lionel Lakes.

204
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:59,770
You wouldn't be contracting with, the City of Birchwood Village wouldn't be contracting with the City of Lionel Lakes.

205
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:05,915
The other way we left it with Tim was that,

206
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:24,355
that it would be very logical for the city to prepare a list of their responsibilities, what we want them to do for monitoring, and then send or meet with him to discuss it and modify it with their help.

207
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:34,801
And then Tim would take that and put it in a draft agreement between his company and the city for the city and the city attorney and everybody to review.

208
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,101
before you actually went and did anything on it.

209
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:49,706
That's how far we progressed on the issue of who's going to monitor the lift stations and how it can be done.

210
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:56,048
Then we talk about the switch to the other subject of the SCADA system.

211
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:07,832
What we've talked about is determining precisely who owns that skating equipment.

212
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:11,796
And I'm not sure who it's going to work on.

213
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:13,958
I think maybe you were going to check into that some more.

214
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,081
I haven't heard results of that research yet.

215
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:21,185
You know, Steve, a couple of things.

216
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:24,388
If you could set the table of how we got to this point,

217
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:33,652
You were involved in some analysis, and we've been struggling with what to do with the lift stations.

218
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:39,657
And I think you've uncovered some information that maybe everybody isn't aware of.

219
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:42,119
So give us background on how we got to this point.

220
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:42,279
Sure.

221
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,522
A little background is that over the past

222
00:15:46,603 --> 00:16:14,954
I wanna say a couple years, you've had real high costs in relation to, one, the services of just monitoring the lift stations, and number two, you've had real high costs in the repair work of any kind of service on the lift station, including replacing the impellers, including the contractor, electrical guy, kindly coming out and

223
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,998
doing whatever they can to get the SCADA system to work.

224
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:30,040
It just boggles my mind as to why they spent so much time and energy trying to get it to work when there are other ways to do it.

225
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:43,983
So the whole objective of the exercise is to get a situation where you're minimizing cost and still maintain the same response time

226
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:53,022
that you have now, that's the overall goal as I see it, unless you guys see something different on the goals.

227
00:16:55,964 --> 00:17:03,568
Right, and we still haven't, as far as it seems to me, the SCADA is still sort of like

228
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:10,903
It's online, but then there's an issue, and the issue is... It drops out.

229
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,646
What would you call it?

230
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,287
A communication failure.

231
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,589
It's a communication alarm.

232
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,309
Right.

233
00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:21,893
And so if you have a communication alarm, then somebody has to go out and determine what's wrong with it.

234
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:22,194
Right.

235
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:26,177
And a lot of fail comms or comm fails.

236
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:29,178
and they don't seem to go away.

237
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:29,678
Right.

238
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:30,419
Right.

239
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:41,004
And so one way to avoid that or to minimize those is to switch to a cellular system, meaning instead of the signals being radio, it's phone lines.

240
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,287
Not hardwired, but regular cell phones.

241
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:49,149
The signals could come either

242
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:59,220
Well, even if you stayed with the SCADA system and sent the signal to City Hall, you'd have the information here at City Hall rather than over at White Bear Lake Township.

243
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,922
The same thing could happen with the cellular system.

244
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:09,484
But with the cellular system, the information would come right to your cell phone.

245
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:15,806
And as many people as you wanted could be on that, the warning system.

246
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:19,888
So those people could see, oh, there's an alarm.

247
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:35,204
And if that one person who's on duty for some reason can't respond in 15 minutes for lift station three or whatever time period you set up for the lift stations, then he could quickly call somebody else and they could respond.

248
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:43,210
But it's on your cell phone and not at an office someplace, either White Bear Lake or the office here.

249
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:47,013
There's less things to break down if you have a cellular system.

250
00:18:49,488 --> 00:19:04,278
And I haven't gotten into details or listed all the advantages and disadvantages of each one because we weren't exactly clear on who owned the existing SCADA system that you've got there.

251
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:05,659
I know you paid for it.

252
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,481
I know you paid a lot of money for it.

253
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:14,626
But it wasn't clear to me in the documents I've reviewed, you know, which are, you know, these documents here.

254
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,148
And there are probably some other documents that maybe you have.

255
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:22,817
who actually owns the equipment that you paid for.

256
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:25,254
Well, if we paid for it, wouldn't we own it?

257
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:32,477
Well, I mean, there's a couple of parts to the SCADA system, the PLCs that got put into the lift stations.

258
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:34,938
So we would probably own those.

259
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:35,598
Probably.

260
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:40,520
It then becomes an issue of who owns the radios.

261
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:50,704
On that, that could be disputed because there's the radio at basically White Bear Township, the master radio, and then there's the

262
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:55,700
Satellite radios that are go at each one of the lift stations kind of thing.

263
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:11,315
So You know and so and so we have that I know that my own company we have a mixture of Cellphone we have a diverse portfolio because everything breaks no matter what technology you use.

264
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:12,936
They all have different failure modes.

265
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:13,297
So I

266
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:24,310
We'll use a com, I mean, and the trend in the industry is to move to a mesh radio, which Randy and I have been talking about, you know, long term would be a good thing for us to do.

267
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,070
Short term, not feasible.

268
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,631
Randy and I have kind of already discussed that a little bit, so.

269
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:34,152
So, cell phones are good technology.

270
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:38,714
We looked at it a few years ago in terms of a cloud service.

271
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:42,915
So, there's a couple of companies out there who will,

272
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:54,090
plug your cell phones into it and they'll monitor it and they'll send you an alarm on your iPhone or on your Android, depending on what you want.

273
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:57,794
and you can acknowledge the alarm from your iPad or whatever.

274
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:06,658
So they're pretty cost effective because you don't have to buy the computer, you don't have to buy the $50,000 worth of software and all the services.

275
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,760
So it's just pretty much a canned application which is very attractive for small municipalities.

276
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,841
But there's a couple of different people who offer that, right Steve?

277
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:16,362
Oh yeah.

278
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,343
Yeah, so it's a good choice.

279
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:27,087
Would you have to have both running, both for a little bit at the same time just to make sure when, like the cell wasn't going to work?

280
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:29,629
I mean, like just you can't turn one off and get the other one going or?

281
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:42,216
We would have to kind of walk around with, you know, see who has the more, I mean, in some areas Verizon is the better offering, in some geographical areas AT&T is the better offering.

282
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:46,899
No, I meant will you have to have the SCADA and the cell phone run at the same time just to like,

283
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,799
make sure there's not that?

284
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:51,981
There would probably be a period of a few days of overlap.

285
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:52,441
Okay, that's fine.

286
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:55,643
And then there's ways of where we could send a signal to both.

287
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,223
Okay.

288
00:21:56,763 --> 00:22:16,552
Yeah, so it's also if you, if for some reason the people that are operating the system for you now have some claim on ownership of whatever equipment that's there, if they have a claim on that, we should know that before we figure out what really is the cost going to be for us to switch.

289
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:27,904
and then we can analyze the cost of, is SCADA better for your situation, or is the cell phone better for your situation at the current time with what we know right now?

290
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:38,710
So it seemed like the next step in the critical path of analyzing what's the best thing to do for minimizing costs in the sewer is to figure out who owns what on the SCADA system.

291
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:40,731
Okay.

292
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,473
You're talking about radio telemetry versus cellulophone telemetry, right?

293
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:46,134
Right.

294
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:46,694
Yeah.

295
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:50,188
A question for you, Randy, because you're right next to the lift station.

296
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:54,189
I was down in that area today and tried to do a text.

297
00:22:54,869 --> 00:23:00,971
And it seemed to me you were in a black hole for cell phone use.

298
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:01,872
Is that a factor?

299
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:05,313
Because I couldn't get texts out until I got up over the hill.

300
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,054
Personally, yes, there are.

301
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:09,555
That's why we've got a landline at our house.

302
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:12,237
We can't get it.

303
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,579
But I'm going to say this, though.

304
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,324
I was able to get some local Wi-Fi at the boulevard from a neighbor's house.

305
00:23:21,464 --> 00:23:22,145
Oh, yeah.

306
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,986
Different issue.

307
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:32,153
We did check the cellular phone signals at each one of the lift stations, and we were able to get a good signal at each one of the three lift stations.

308
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:35,255
AT&T or Verizon.

309
00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:35,655
Verizon.

310
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:42,238
Okay, just a, just a, you know, anecdotally a question.

311
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:43,640
Are you with Verizon?

312
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:44,541
Yeah.

313
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:45,442
Oh, okay.

314
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:46,063
Yeah, and they're good.

315
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:47,424
I thought.

316
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:48,866
Until today.

317
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:50,308
What?

318
00:23:50,468 --> 00:23:51,029
Is your phone?

319
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,190
No.

320
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:12,723
okay this commercial paid by so um Steve one other question about this whole scenario is because you know we've got the elephant in the living room which was the the limited size of our holding tank

321
00:24:13,524 --> 00:24:19,828
because that's a liability that just seems to be there and not go away.

322
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:23,029
So how does this factor into your analysis?

323
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,391
Because we don't have, I don't know if we have 15 minutes from what you.

324
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:29,693
Well, you may not have 15 minutes.

325
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:37,718
We're figuring the 15 minutes based on the two years worth of daily flow data in this,

326
00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:44,859
Every day, someone reads the running time meter at the lift station, and we know how much the pumps pump.

327
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:47,042
So it's a running time meter analysis to get the data.

328
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:49,625
So that has some inaccuracies in it, just to begin with.

329
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:57,554
We took that two years' data, and we come up with an average daily flow for that time period, then using engineering numbers.

330
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:06,502
to factor up to where we can say the peak day is X number of gallons per minute and the peak hour is X number of gallons per minute.

331
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:18,974
And then based on the size of the storage tank that is there, because we measured it, we could say, well, yeah, before it gets into the pipe itself, it's clearly 15 minutes.

332
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:22,997
And then we don't know the amount of storage that's in the pipe.

333
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:29,483
or the manholes that are upstream from before it actually floods back into a house.

334
00:25:29,603 --> 00:25:31,884
We just don't know that information.

335
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:34,206
So yeah, there's a very short period of time.

336
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:39,050
And no wiper had to be there within a half an hour.

337
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,451
Oh, it's less than that.

338
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,073
It's less than that.

339
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:47,237
In fact, you know, what he's saying is they had a half hour call out.

340
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:47,677
We saw 15, 20 minutes.

341
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:58,070
Well, when we did the test, and you know, that was like eight minutes.

342
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:03,651
When you did the test, you turned off the pump, and then it backed up to the point where it was now going into the pipe.

343
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:08,152
Relatively speaking, I know the pipe has volume, but relatively speaking, not much.

344
00:26:08,753 --> 00:26:13,774
Eight minutes seemed to be sort of like you're starting to push the envelope in terms of how much space you've got left.

345
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:21,035
Right, and then the manholes upstream too, they're four foot diameter, so you've got some storage in those manholes, but again, not a lot of storage.

346
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:23,396
So there's a very short period of time

347
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:33,626
The critical point is that on lift station 2, if you have an alarm on lift station 2, it could be many different things.

348
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:39,431
It could be that one pump is out for whatever reason.

349
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:46,278
But if one pump's out, you don't have to get there in 15 minutes because the other pump's still working.

350
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:53,330
And you could have that information on the cell phone saying, oh, yeah, the other pump's working.

351
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:55,873
So then you wouldn't have to respond in 15 minutes.

352
00:26:57,154 --> 00:27:08,846
The time when you would really have to respond fast is if all the power is out, or if both pumps have stopped for some reason, or if there is a high-level alarm.

353
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:15,549
meaning, you know, both pumps are stopped or something's wrong, the flow is not going anywhere, it's backing up.

354
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:32,816
Then really the only thing a person can do is show up, look at it, and then oftentimes it's first call is to a vacuum truck company to come out and start sucking up the waste water from the wet well.

355
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:38,384
and hauling it away until one of the pumps is working again.

356
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,105
So it's those critical points is when you've got a high-level alarm.

357
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:43,705
It's most critical.

358
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,586
That's where we go on, right?

359
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:48,306
Right.

360
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:49,366
It's going down at one time.

361
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:53,887
Well, I don't think you've had many power failures here.

362
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:56,427
And if you had power failures, they've been short.

363
00:27:57,027 --> 00:27:59,948
And now you're putting in a backup emergency generator.

364
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:02,300
which is operated by gas.

365
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,682
So if you've got a power failure, you've still got gas to run the emergency generator to run the pumps.

366
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:13,525
But you can still have a failure of something on the emergency generator, or the automatic transfer switch, too.

367
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:16,767
So you can still have all those problems.

368
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:20,008
Anything's possible, but your limits go way down.

369
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:22,509
Your chances go way down.

370
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,211
The risk of having a backup is less and less.

371
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:28,132
It's a smaller and smaller amount.

372
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:37,943
I guess what I was asking is, knowing that we have limited capacity, how does that filter into the timeframe or timeline of what you recommend?

373
00:28:41,246 --> 00:28:42,847
In terms of any change or no change?

374
00:28:46,217 --> 00:29:02,766
The decision I see on whether or not you want to increase the capacity, the emergency storage capacity of lift station number two is independent of what we're doing on this SCADA system and the monitoring.

375
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:06,608
That seems to be an independent decision to me.

376
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:07,889
That can be separate.

377
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:13,232
You can do nothing on that and rely on people to respond quickly.

378
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:25,104
And I don't think anybody's done this analysis, but how much money do you save if you have a larger storage capacity?

379
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:29,344
Meaning you spend a lot of money to have that larger storage capacity.

380
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:34,906
How much money do you save every month or year because you've got that larger storage capacity?

381
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:41,527
Meaning are you going to save monitoring time for someone to go look at that?

382
00:29:42,605 --> 00:29:50,090
You know, we're typically going to, I think we're going to have the people come and look at the lift stations maybe once a week, but that's about it.

383
00:29:50,891 --> 00:30:00,137
There is some benefit to have someone come, you know, once a week, and we can talk about that further in greater detail, but having someone come once a week is really helpful.

384
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:05,321
Even if you've got the emergency storage capacity?

385
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:06,382
That's large.

386
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,961
I'm not sure if that's answering your question.

387
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:09,821
No, it did.

388
00:30:10,982 --> 00:30:24,911
The other thing that got us to this point was, I think, the fact that we were going through impellers every year or two, and that they should be lasting 10 years.

389
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:29,353
So that was, I think, sort of what precipitated this whole conversation.

390
00:30:29,874 --> 00:30:32,735
And how does that issue get addressed in this equation?

391
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:33,516
Right.

392
00:30:34,176 --> 00:30:36,418
I'm analyzing the records that you've got.

393
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:44,641
that Mike gave me, and I don't have an answer yet on the frequency that you've actually had on the impellers.

394
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:58,065
I do know that you've had, at lift station number two, rags in the wet well and garbage bags in the wet well that they've sucked out recently.

395
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:04,648
I know these are things that are really uncommon in a sanitary sewer system, but they do happen.

396
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:17,547
The impeller data that I saw and talked to the people about and saw pictures of the impellers that they took out and replaced showed a lot of wear and tear on the impellers.

397
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:28,637
Lift station number one, the impellers there showed signs of cavitation meaning

398
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:44,680
the air gets on the impellers themselves, and then when the pressure changes in the fluid, it cavitates and pushes and collapses the airspace and damages the impeller.

399
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:56,949
That lift station number one also has had some situation where they've had air locks, meaning it wasn't sucking like it should be.

400
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:05,002
And so they did put in impellers, new ones in there, and hopefully you won't have so many of those callouts.

401
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:06,483
When were they put in?

402
00:32:07,264 --> 00:32:12,349
It was either the latter part of last year or the first part of this year.

403
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:12,849
Okay.

404
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,491
So it's very recent.

405
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:16,513
But the impellers show a lot of wear.

406
00:32:18,013 --> 00:32:30,662
The, you know, when we went with White Bear Township, which was January, I think, of last year, at that time we were told there was garbage bags in the wet well, and the impellers were worn to the nubbins.

407
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:32,823
I know that, and I know we had them replaced.

408
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:40,468
So now we're told again, the impellers are worn, so you've got a year and a half that's transpired, and they've worn out.

409
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:42,149
So there's your time frame.

410
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:46,912
I know there's another shorter period as well, just previous to that with the replacement.

411
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:49,635
So that still needs to be addressed.

412
00:32:50,676 --> 00:33:04,350
Yeah, the data that I've seen on the bills, I've seen where they replaced the impellers on both pumps on lift station number one and one of the impellers on lift station number three.

413
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:10,256
And they put in a whole new pump on lift station number two, which means brand new impellers and everything.

414
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:10,456
Yeah.

415
00:33:12,268 --> 00:33:18,692
And I haven't gotten all the way back on the records, but I don't know that there is records that go real far back.

416
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:32,423
Well, we were just wondering if we had to do something different in order to make these things last longer, because I thought we were told it was a 10-year period in which we would look at replacement.

417
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:35,870
Yeah, the pellets should last about 7 to 10 years.

418
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,011
They really should.

419
00:33:37,572 --> 00:33:42,519
So, while you're seeing it occur sooner than that, I still don't have an answer yet for you.

420
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:44,601
But I haven't gone through all the records yet.

421
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:46,304
The newer toilets got larger throats on them.

422
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,563
And they'll take down almost anything compared to an old toilet that would plug up really easy.

423
00:33:54,304 --> 00:33:59,870
So if there's any kids or anything out there, if they put something in the toilet, they hit that lever, it's gone.

424
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:02,332
It's going to end up in our system.

425
00:34:02,412 --> 00:34:05,055
I believe that's where a lot of our problems are.

426
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:14,964
It'd be interesting if you could talk to us, maybe some other cities, or if everyone, it's not just Birchwood who's ran through Impeller, it's maybe other cities are too.

427
00:34:15,244 --> 00:34:17,326
Maybe next month you can tell us, I guess, or let us know.

428
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:21,430
Most of these things have a three inch throat on them now, so I don't care.

429
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,613
If your keys fall in there and it gets flushed, they're gone.

430
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:31,348
Well, and I think, you know, just to bring this together, I think what happened is we had the impeller issue.

431
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:34,451
It was costing us a lot of time and repairs.

432
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:36,332
Steve got involved.

433
00:34:36,352 --> 00:34:39,254
He looked at the big picture and said, well, you've got some other issues going on.

434
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:40,295
What can I do to help?

435
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:43,037
And now he's come back with this analysis.

436
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,061
You're just giving us an update and so we'll expect something when?

437
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:50,881
Right.

438
00:34:51,541 --> 00:35:09,226
I think the next step would be to make sure that we know who owns these equipment and then based on that, I'll get prices for and analyze what's the best thing to do with monitoring the list stations and SCADA system so it actually does work.

439
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:10,806
And impellers then too?

440
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:11,046
Yes.

441
00:35:11,366 --> 00:35:11,646
Okay.

442
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:13,307
Right.

443
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:14,007
It's just sort of a

444
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,971
a report, an analysis of where we are and what we can do to do better.

445
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:21,112
Yep.

446
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,392
So far today, it's just an update.

447
00:35:22,832 --> 00:35:23,092
Okay.

448
00:35:24,213 --> 00:35:24,673
Sounds great.

449
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:25,913
Thank you.

450
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:26,854
You're welcome.

451
00:35:28,014 --> 00:35:28,294
Okay.

452
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:29,175
See you next time.

453
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:29,455
Okay.

454
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:29,955
Sounds good.

455
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:30,655
Thank you very much.

456
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,235
Have a great fourth.

457
00:35:31,555 --> 00:35:31,695
Yep.

458
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:32,276
Thank you.

459
00:35:35,077 --> 00:35:35,337
Okay.

460
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:37,377
Home Energy Squad presentation.

461
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:39,958
Randy, this is something you talked about?

462
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:40,458
Yes.

463
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:41,599
Hi, Randy.

464
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:41,919
Hi.

465
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,620
I spoke on the phone last month.

466
00:35:48,937 --> 00:35:50,797
And do I just signal to you for the next?

467
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:52,378
Okay.

468
00:35:55,678 --> 00:35:59,059
Well, thank you for inviting me to come in and speak to you tonight.

469
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:11,042
My name is Terry Chaney with Neighborhood Energy Connection, which is a 30-year-old nonprofit based in St.

470
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:11,462
Paul.

471
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:12,662
We partner with

472
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:20,013
Excel Energy to improve energy efficiency in Minnesota households.

473
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:27,859
The mission is pretty simple.

474
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:33,763
We improve people's lives by making energy conservation easy.

475
00:36:35,244 --> 00:36:42,289
And the ways that we do that are through our home energy squad visits, energy audits, rebates,

476
00:36:43,508 --> 00:36:50,151
helping to complete energy projects and sometimes financing for the work.

477
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:56,354
And why it's important, one of the big reasons is cost.

478
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:58,494
We spend a lot here in Minnesota.

479
00:36:58,514 --> 00:37:06,478
Another reason is a more efficient home is more comfortable and less harmful to the environment.

480
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:16,867
And this is a breakdown of the typical Minnesota homeowner's energy usage.

481
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:22,649
And it also reflects energy costs.

482
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:27,311
So our programs are designed to address these main areas.

483
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:28,292
Next.

484
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:38,422
And one way to think of improving energy efficiency is a series of steps.

485
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:50,497
And NEC can help you achieve your projects step by step wherever you are along this metaphorical staircase.

486
00:37:52,206 --> 00:38:01,757
But a lot of people, like Randy, are introduced to our organization with a home energy squad visit.

487
00:38:02,557 --> 00:38:03,398
Oh, I'm sorry, next.

488
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,361
Look like Ghostbusters.

489
00:38:06,382 --> 00:38:08,624
They look like Ghostbusters there.

490
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:11,307
Kind of has a Reservoir Dogs kind of.

491
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:21,841
And a lot of people may recognize the iconic transit, which is what we bring to your house when we do the visit.

492
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:32,598
And the energy-saving items that we install in your home are designed to pay for themselves in one year.

493
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:47,530
And since most people have busy lives, the Home Energy Squad will save you time by installing these items for you in one visit at an affordable price.

494
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:56,293
able to deliver the program at an affordable price because of the partnership with Excel.

495
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:06,555
And the average visit is usually about an hour, sometimes as long as an hour and a half.

496
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:17,217
And during that time, we can install the items you see here, weather stripping on your door, low-flow shower heads, and faucet aerators.

497
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:26,308
programmable thermostats, water heater blankets, and we'll replace your incandescent bulbs with CFLs.

498
00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:40,473
Also, the visit includes a walkthrough assessment where we check your furnace, the water heater, your attic insulation, and then can make recommendations based on what we see.

499
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:50,415
And I'll just go through a few of the items in a little bit more detail.

500
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:57,283
A lot of what we do is replacing incandescent light bulbs, which are inefficient.

501
00:39:57,383 --> 00:40:01,347
We put in CFL bulbs, which last longer.

502
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:03,349
They also use 25% less energy.

503
00:40:06,952 --> 00:40:16,858
And for comparison, a 13-watt CFL bulb puts out about as much light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb.

504
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:19,740
You guys have not moved over to LEDs yet then?

505
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:28,648
We do offer those a la carte right now, but we're... Just with all the CFL problems and mercury and disposal and stuff like that.

506
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:29,768
Yes, definitely.

507
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:36,230
We do contract with Excel, but yeah, in the future, that seems to be the direction that we're headed.

508
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:36,470
Perfect.

509
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:37,091
Thank you.

510
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:40,092
We also can install...

511
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:44,814
low flow shower heads and faucet aerators.

512
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:51,676
And in addition to saving water, they also save gas.

513
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:59,620
Most faucet aerators in our homes already use about two to two and a half gallons per minute.

514
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,242
The ones that we install use one to one and a half gallons per minute.

515
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:14,945
And if you don't already have a programmable thermostat, we can put one of those and set it up for you as well.

516
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:21,329
It's one of the easiest ways that you can save money in your home.

517
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:32,937
The EPA estimates that for every one degree you set back in an eight-hour period is equivalent to saving 1% on your energy bill.

518
00:41:36,926 --> 00:41:46,290
And if you have a lot of these items installed already, you can also schedule home energy audits.

519
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:52,233
We use diagnostic tools like the blower door test and the infrared imaging.

520
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:58,748
And that can reveal air leaks in your home.

521
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:05,372
We can also provide a profile of your home's overall energy performance.

522
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:10,115
And the energy audit can be scheduled as a standalone visit.

523
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:15,218
It can also be combined with home energy squad visits.

524
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:25,545
And just a quick word on the phrase energy efficiency that I've used multiple times.

525
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:36,750
I just wanted to highlight the distinction between our work doing energy efficiency and renewable energy because they can and often are used interchangeably.

526
00:42:37,844 --> 00:42:44,587
And there are different approaches to reducing energy, but can also be complementary.

527
00:42:45,468 --> 00:43:04,737
Thus, for those that might be considering a solar project, it's often economical to focus on energy efficiency first, and that way, when you do your solar project, more of your home can be powered by the sun.

528
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:18,916
As I mentioned, the programs we offer are affordable because of the partnership with Xcel Energy.

529
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:24,818
The cost of a typical visit is, for the home energy squad, is $70.

530
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:35,162
However, we can often offer those for half off if we're doing visits in the same geographical area.

531
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:47,479
And we believe it would be possible in Birchwood Village over the next year to do 50 visits in your community.

532
00:43:48,760 --> 00:44:05,813
Other cities that we have worked with have helped us promote and do outreach at local events, on social media, in newsletters, and we hope to work with you as well in ways that

533
00:44:06,425 --> 00:44:08,408
you think would be appropriate here.

534
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:16,480
Anyone watching can also contact me directly by phone or email.

535
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,741
If you want to learn more.

536
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:22,802
Michael have your phone number and stuff here too at City Hall.

537
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:23,843
To learn more.

538
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:27,925
And with that, I will say thank you.

539
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,946
And if there's time, if you have any questions, I'd be happy to.

540
00:44:31,106 --> 00:44:33,087
I just wanted them to come here because they came to my house.

541
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:33,968
They came to my house.

542
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:39,030
And literally, when they left, I had a bag of light bulbs for $35.

543
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:43,653
They weather-stripped the door, replaced some shower heads.

544
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:45,253
And it's like, how can you lose?

545
00:44:45,274 --> 00:44:47,955
They've been to my house before too.

546
00:44:48,575 --> 00:44:51,236
When it was a consortium neighborhood energy consortium st.

547
00:44:51,256 --> 00:45:01,281
Paul neighborhood energy consortium way back when yeah So my child's doing the energy audit in the picture Yeah, yeah, you know my wife used to work there forever, so yeah

548
00:45:03,145 --> 00:45:13,438
Yeah, and Excel will send out occasional emails and might put a little flyer in your mailing.

549
00:45:13,498 --> 00:45:17,963
But otherwise, it's kind of on us to do our own outreach.

550
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:43,980
Works out well when we partner with cities to help reach more people because like Randy was saying it really is You know a valuable service so Yeah, we would like to work with you to would you work with our City Hall here is that not a not a family I guess this well, we're more residential but

551
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,811
Okay, they just work with residential.

552
00:45:54,152 --> 00:46:00,437
What what is the average cost of an energy audit where they put the for the blower door or the infrared scan?

553
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:06,342
Yeah, the the The blower door that's kind of the standard audit.

554
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:15,170
That's $60 and the infrared is a hundred total or both total

555
00:46:18,388 --> 00:46:21,089
Are there bulbs that we can replace all these?

556
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:23,169
You counted them?

557
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,470
We have over 70 fluorescent bulbs in the building.

558
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,731
But these are energy efficient.

559
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:29,551
Well, no.

560
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:34,392
The new LEDs, actually, they make the LED equivalent of fluorescents.

561
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:38,993
And they are considerably cheaper to run than the fluorescents.

562
00:46:40,874 --> 00:46:45,295
There are rebate programs to help you make the conversion.

563
00:46:47,457 --> 00:46:48,438
Why don't you use the mic here?

564
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:50,200
Yeah, this is Danielle, by the way.

565
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,822
She is a co-worker of mine.

566
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:03,519
I think Excel has rebate programs for, I mean, they work with Home Depot.

567
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:13,882
I shouldn't plug them, but for the LED discounts, if you want to do that, I know that they have the discounts if you need to replace a furnace.

568
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:16,403
They have discounts if you go to a geothermal.

569
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:23,965
They have discounts if you do a foam insulation, like a hot foam in your ceiling, which is very energy efficient.

570
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:27,446
That can really tremendously reduce your cooling costs.

571
00:47:27,955 --> 00:47:32,417
I work for Excel Energy, so I have to, you know, I'm just plugging the company, that's all.

572
00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:32,877
Okay.

573
00:47:34,698 --> 00:47:35,418
They do good work.

574
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:36,079
Sounds good.

575
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:39,980
So if you can work with Mike and Mike can coordinate something on the website, that'd be great.

576
00:47:41,121 --> 00:47:42,541
Newsletter, an extra newsletter maybe.

577
00:47:43,242 --> 00:47:43,962
Okay.

578
00:47:44,142 --> 00:47:51,205
I did leave some packets back here that has more info about the other programs.

579
00:47:51,545 --> 00:47:55,187
We offer my cards in there, so let me know if you have questions.

580
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,300
I would say if you're a citizen watching this, take advantage of it.

581
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,601
You'll see it's well, well worth your money.

582
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:07,363
Randy, if you want to put something in the newsletter, then just get that to me by August.

583
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:11,665
Yeah, and if there's any way that I can help with that, just let me know.

584
00:48:12,506 --> 00:48:12,846
Perfect.

585
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:19,089
But if there's a coordinated visit, then we could do something that could lower the cost for people even more, it sounds like.

586
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,850
The combined visit?

587
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:21,210
Yeah.

588
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,131
Yeah, the combined visit.

589
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:30,941
The price on that is, well, you schedule that with Excel.

590
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:42,324
And if you do the combined visit, then the home energy squad portion ends up being $20, and the audit portion is $60.

591
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:44,825
So it's a total of $80.

592
00:48:46,186 --> 00:48:55,389
You pay $20 at the visit for the home energy squad, and then Excel bills you for the audit portion on your utility bill.

593
00:48:57,023 --> 00:48:58,064
Good, all right.

594
00:48:58,584 --> 00:48:59,845
Okay, all right, thanks for coming.

595
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:01,746
Thanks a lot for coming, appreciate it.

596
00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:11,713
Okay, next item is the MS4, Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program Review.

597
00:49:13,374 --> 00:49:19,118
At this point, I'll open it up for public hearing, which has been noticed in the White Bear Press.

598
00:49:22,328 --> 00:49:23,389
I move we close the public hearing.

599
00:49:23,709 --> 00:49:24,530
Okay is there a second?

600
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,591
Second.

601
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:27,512
All right all those in favor?

602
00:49:28,153 --> 00:49:28,573
Aye.

603
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:29,213
Opposed?

604
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:38,100
This is something that we're obligated to do following up just giving public notice of what we've done in the past year.

605
00:49:38,161 --> 00:49:41,143
Mike you want to just give us a heads up on what's going on with that?

606
00:49:44,323 --> 00:49:46,306
with the report that's due?

607
00:49:46,386 --> 00:49:50,070
Well just you know the fact of what this is and what it entails.

608
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,692
Oh yes thank you mayor and council.

609
00:49:52,733 --> 00:50:02,045
The MS4 stormwater pollution prevention program is just a report that's due to the state on an annual basis.

610
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:19,953
The city's plan for how they handle stormwater and stormwater drainage throughout the city and the, I believe the measure of the catch basins as well.

611
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:28,336
We're required to have a public hearing at a meeting and the report is due at the end of June.

612
00:50:30,023 --> 00:50:34,624
This is the same form we've used for how many times in a row?

613
00:50:36,205 --> 00:50:46,247
The permit is every five years and we started in 2013 so it is the same technically until we have to reapply in 2018.

614
00:50:49,594 --> 00:50:58,458
And it's a licensing program, so I think they charge us $400 a year for the benefit of giving them the report that it's pretty much the same every year.

615
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:08,863
But we do monitor our catch basins, and in fact, they were monitored last month, and half of them came back as not needing any attention.

616
00:51:11,104 --> 00:51:14,525
So there are just a couple that do need to be cleaned out.

617
00:51:16,686 --> 00:51:27,592
So I think our street sweeping program and maybe our salting program has caused our amount of sediment going into the lake to be less than previous years.

618
00:51:29,193 --> 00:51:38,678
I know, talking to Mike, I think we kind of fell off of the wagon for this cleaning out the catch basins and things like that, but I think you're figuring out a schedule now, aren't you, Mike?

619
00:51:39,198 --> 00:52:04,707
Yep, I've been working with mark on that in the last couple weeks I've received three bids from separate companies on cleaning out the catch basins in the past We've done one in the fall and one in the spring and considering none of the basins need immediate attention I would like to get that back onto like an October April schedule If that's okay with the council, it's just an inspect and clean if needed.

620
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:07,548
It's not like it's a every time they go out and suck it so

621
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,260
Well, we monitor our own catch basins.

622
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,821
So we do that spring and fall.

623
00:52:13,761 --> 00:52:18,842
Rather than bid that out, it doesn't take but 45 minutes.

624
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:24,623
But on the basis of that, then there's an obligation to, if they're full, to have them cleaned out.

625
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,083
And as I said, there are five that need to be cleaned out now.

626
00:52:27,663 --> 00:52:33,004
And I don't know, I mean, just so you have a ballpark, Infratech does it for $220 a basin.

627
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:35,045
And I couldn't find anyone cheaper than that.

628
00:52:36,345 --> 00:52:47,289
In the past so what we've done in the past we just call them up say no granted there might be somebody who comes in cheaper and that'd be fine, but it's That's what we that's been our ballpark in the past.

629
00:52:47,509 --> 00:52:49,730
So we missed our spring monitoring.

630
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:59,733
No, we got done That was the list that I sent you was just measured in April, but there's a but we're in mayday mode to clean them out though.

631
00:52:59,753 --> 00:52:59,773
I

632
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:04,313
Well, once the report was just done, I think, three weeks ago.

633
00:53:04,353 --> 00:53:07,956
And on that basis, then... No.

634
00:53:08,256 --> 00:53:14,481
On that basis, when they are full, because we monitor them twice a year, we say, okay, these need to be cleaned out now.

635
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,071
when they hit a certain level.

636
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:23,154
So there's no reason for spring and fall contracting then it sounds like.

637
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:24,895
We just monitor them ourselves and then.

638
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:28,477
I didn't word that correctly.

639
00:53:28,577 --> 00:53:31,519
We monitor twice a year and then clean as necessary.

640
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,503
You can go ahead and have a company probably do it, but I don't think, like I say, when I've

641
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:43,688
In the past, I had gone and, oh, you do stormwater clean up.

642
00:53:43,748 --> 00:53:43,948
Great.

643
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:44,448
How much is it?

644
00:53:44,548 --> 00:53:46,390
And prices can be astronomical.

645
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,032
And Infratech has been able to accommodate us.

646
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,334
And we just say, these are the addresses.

647
00:53:52,374 --> 00:53:53,035
These are the ones.

648
00:53:53,135 --> 00:53:53,816
And it gets done.

649
00:53:54,056 --> 00:53:56,858
They're pretty good about it.

650
00:53:56,878 --> 00:54:00,901
$220 a catch basin was the last cost.

651
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:05,725
Mary, do you need a motion to approve this filing, this form?

652
00:54:07,226 --> 00:54:07,847
What do we need here?

653
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:21,170
think no I think that's just administrative it's a public hearing we're obligated to do that and this is just an update to the council okay okay the next item is

654
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:44,438
The next item is Sherry bus, and you know knowing that we have a meeting tomorrow I'd ask that we just continue that item to for discussion until tomorrow so make sense sure I will not be here, but okay, and then On that basis I would also recommend we not adjourn, but we just recess until tomorrow so we carry over that business at that time

655
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,641
We'll get to that at the end of the meeting.

656
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:53,628
Second reading then of the structural height code language.

657
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,072
Mike, do you want to tee that up?

658
00:55:02,437 --> 00:55:05,798
Yeah, I just have mike give a little brief intro before we do that.

659
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:06,218
All right.

660
00:55:06,338 --> 00:55:30,065
Thanks mayor and council, um over the last six months or so we've The council and planning commission have been trying to come up with some Language for our 202 30205 045 structure height code language to kind of make it better understanding On how to calculate the average structure height per building We've come up with a few

661
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:39,210
different paragraphs with different wording and isn't quite clear.

662
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:51,637
And then you'll see option two that is provided in the packet, makes it, simplifies the language to make it easier to calculate the overall structure height.

663
00:55:54,912 --> 00:56:01,699
Okay at this time I'll open the public hearing to discuss the proposed code options.

664
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:04,201
Is there any interest in that?

665
00:56:06,683 --> 00:56:08,845
Okay need a motion to close the public hearing.

666
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:09,326
So moved.

667
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:10,407
Is there a second?

668
00:56:10,927 --> 00:56:11,728
All those in favor?

669
00:56:12,048 --> 00:56:12,729
Aye.

670
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:14,491
That carries.

671
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:24,578
So I think it's safe to say we've had a full discussion on this topic.

672
00:56:24,678 --> 00:56:35,283
And there's two choices that I asked Mike to put on the second one, which is our previous code.

673
00:56:35,303 --> 00:56:44,067
And if you go back and look at our previous code, it's not much different than what is being in option two with the changes

674
00:56:46,553 --> 00:56:53,377
It basically takes out the roof issue of how do you measure a roof and what's the roof line and what are the variables when you have multiple roofs.

675
00:56:54,538 --> 00:56:58,080
And it basically gets us back to where we started from with the DNR.

676
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:01,002
And then incorporating a grade plane.

677
00:57:03,704 --> 00:57:07,466
And so those are the issues the city council needs to wrangle with.

678
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:13,670
And I would recommend in either case exhibit C, which is included in option one.

679
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:28,113
with the illustration for grade elevation that exhibit C actually would be exhibit A referred to in the second code, in the second option.

680
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:31,715
It should have been put in there again.

681
00:57:32,796 --> 00:57:43,702
So you get the intention of how you calculate these numbers with the simplicity that we seem to eventually get to with

682
00:57:45,234 --> 00:57:47,395
when we've done it with tree ordinances and other issues.

683
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:51,738
And I'm not sure what the council, how the council wants to proceed, but those are the two options.

684
00:57:51,758 --> 00:57:54,539
Is there any other comments?

685
00:57:57,481 --> 00:58:01,663
And once we pick an option, we go to the DNR for approval then?

686
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:09,766
I think option number two has already been approved by the DNR, so we basically say, we've cleaned up our code, so it's clear to everybody.

687
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:11,427
Here's what it is.

688
00:58:12,809 --> 00:58:20,555
We'd want to pick an option and then run it back past the DNR again, and then they would say yes, not that.

689
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,137
Mike, have you had any contact with the DNR?

690
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:30,524
Mayor and Council, I have tried in the last month numerous times to get a hold of the DNR with no response.

691
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:47,289
I don't have Alan here, we don't have Alan here tonight, but I would think we could confer with him, knowing if we went with option two, that we basically already had DNR's blessing and we don't need that again in order to accomplish that.

692
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:48,310
I think what we're doing is...

693
00:58:49,312 --> 00:58:54,656
clearing up the issues so that we don't have this misunderstanding and misinterpretation.

694
00:58:54,676 --> 00:59:00,139
I think on 232 Wildwood, we had about three different interpretations of how the code applies.

695
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:05,463
And despite the fact that we've tried to clear everything up, it actually became more muddled.

696
00:59:06,064 --> 00:59:07,925
I think we need to get back to something more simple.

697
00:59:08,005 --> 00:59:10,827
And the DNR signed off on this before.

698
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:18,132
I guess I would recommend we talk to Alan before we say what we have to do with the DNR, but we might be there already.

699
00:59:21,702 --> 00:59:23,445
I don't know, I think we should still send them a copy.

700
00:59:23,805 --> 00:59:24,085
Oh, yeah.

701
00:59:24,146 --> 00:59:25,347
Oh, yeah.

702
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,512
By your silence, UVIX.

703
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:34,060
Are you going to move forward on option two?

704
00:59:35,943 --> 00:59:36,584
I can second that.

705
00:59:37,111 --> 00:59:38,392
Okay, any other discussion?

706
00:59:38,813 --> 00:59:43,016
I think that you've set out, I think, some great reasons for doing it.

707
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:44,757
DNR has kind of signed off on this.

708
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:45,979
It's simplifying the code.

709
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:57,568
I mean, this thing, it's going to come up again because it is such a confusing darn, you know, and people keep pushing up against that height and it's, somebody's going to find a loophole in what we did.

710
00:59:57,788 --> 00:59:59,690
So it's like, but we're going to give it our best shot.

711
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,311
I guess that's what I want to say, so.

712
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:05,535
Any other discussion?

713
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:14,312
Okay all those in.

714
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:20,036
Sorry we will talk with Alan and then have an actual approval by the DNR.

715
01:00:20,136 --> 01:00:29,082
I mean that was kind of a big deal so I think we should have an actual DNR says yes there's some kind of stamp there from the DNR saying yes yes yes yes then we're it's in.

716
01:00:29,762 --> 01:00:34,323
Well, I had spoken with Mike before the meeting.

717
01:00:34,343 --> 01:00:36,363
I think we can table it till tomorrow.

718
01:00:37,663 --> 01:00:41,724
Mike can come up with a summary resolution.

719
01:00:42,224 --> 01:00:49,505
We can adopt the summary resolution and have that then approved at that time that conforms with this language.

720
01:00:51,286 --> 01:00:54,466
And then Alan can enlighten us.

721
01:00:55,146 --> 01:00:57,887
Knowing that this is basically what we've done before, Alan can enlighten us.

722
01:00:58,227 --> 01:00:58,847
What do we do next?

723
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:26,508
it might be helpful Mike if you could take our exist the 2000 code if you have access to that and just show the few changes that were made from the 2000 code and I think substantively there isn't much change it's just in an explanation of what these items mean just your three things strike out and underline everything yep yep okay

724
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:30,540
So I think we can deal with that all tomorrow.

725
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:32,722
I know Alan will get back to us by tomorrow.

726
01:01:33,042 --> 01:01:35,804
Whether the dean does, I think he'll enlighten us.

727
01:01:36,404 --> 01:01:37,025
What do we do next?

728
01:01:37,605 --> 01:01:37,905
OK?

729
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:42,849
There's a motion.

730
01:01:43,189 --> 01:01:50,173
Yeah, there's a motion to approve it and then give final approval tomorrow.

731
01:01:50,394 --> 01:01:50,774
That's right.

732
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:51,174
Sound good?

733
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:51,694
Yes, good.

734
01:01:51,915 --> 01:01:52,635
All those in favor?

735
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:53,115
Aye.

736
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:53,436
Aye.

737
01:01:54,532 --> 01:01:55,073
Any opposed?

738
01:01:55,773 --> 01:01:56,334
That carries.

739
01:01:56,634 --> 01:01:57,335
All those relieved?

740
01:01:57,816 --> 01:01:58,496
Aye.

741
01:01:58,636 --> 01:01:59,337
Yeah.

742
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:00,859
Okay.

743
01:02:00,939 --> 01:02:01,540
Randy, you're up.

744
01:02:02,641 --> 01:02:03,141
Some updates.

745
01:02:03,522 --> 01:02:11,671
I'm pursuing talking about LEDs, replacing all the streetlights in Birchwood with LEDs, which will really significantly save money.

746
01:02:11,691 --> 01:02:12,852
We've talked about this before.

747
01:02:12,872 --> 01:02:16,336
I'm actually kind of trading phone calls with a person from Xcel Energy.

748
01:02:16,996 --> 01:02:36,077
I mean the question comes up who owns the lights and thinking it's one of those we'll figure these things out that and we'll also when we talk to the people from Excel is it gonna be worth it to do it or not to to replace for us to replace them or not so well the light burns out we replace with an LED

749
01:02:37,163 --> 01:02:38,004
That's what they're doing now.

750
01:02:38,184 --> 01:02:44,090
They said they've actually placed two lights in Birchwood already with LEDs, so I don't know which ones they are.

751
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:47,453
That's probably the least expensive way of going about it.

752
01:02:47,493 --> 01:02:50,236
If they come in and do it all, then it's going to hit us really hard.

753
01:02:50,256 --> 01:02:56,122
Actually, Accel says they're on a two-year schedule to replace all the street lights in basically this part of the world with LEDs.

754
01:02:56,742 --> 01:02:58,444
So that's on a two-year schedule to do it.

755
01:02:59,745 --> 01:03:01,427
So it's already happening.

756
01:03:01,627 --> 01:03:03,969
That's what I heard from the guys.

757
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,009
That's what I was told too.

758
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:09,493
So pretty much everything they're replacing with LEDs as they're burning out.

759
01:03:09,673 --> 01:03:10,073
That's right.

760
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:12,075
They're just replacing the whole kit and caboodle.

761
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:23,224
It's just cheaper for the company to put in more energy efficient bulbs and reduce energy usage because then they don't have to build another power plant.

762
01:03:23,864 --> 01:03:24,425
For a little while.

763
01:03:26,396 --> 01:03:27,816
Well, they haven't in a long time.

764
01:03:27,977 --> 01:03:31,598
Yeah, they're real trying hard to meet their PUC requirements.

765
01:03:32,698 --> 01:03:40,521
You know, Randy, Chris had looked into this issue before he left, so at least a year ago.

766
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:45,022
And the communication he had with Excel was, yes, it's coming online.

767
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:46,563
Yes, it's coming within the next two years.

768
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:47,823
Yes, we can do it for you.

769
01:03:48,343 --> 01:03:50,184
And yes, it'll reduce your savings by about 8%.

770
01:03:50,224 --> 01:03:51,624
Yeah, 7%, as I would heard.

771
01:03:53,445 --> 01:03:54,386
So I'm off by a little bit.

772
01:03:54,687 --> 01:04:01,835
Anyway, but we know, I mean, from an analysis, we know that the cost of electricity is significantly.

773
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:03,377
It's like 15% of the total cost.

774
01:04:04,098 --> 01:04:10,745
So other communities have, you know, the payback period is, I think you said it, like five years or something.

775
01:04:12,454 --> 01:04:18,480
So if we get ahead of the curve, we can, I think what we'd be saying is we are entering into being our own utility.

776
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:18,960
That's right.

777
01:04:19,061 --> 01:04:19,761
Our own, yeah.

778
01:04:20,242 --> 01:04:24,746
And I don't, you know, that might be the way to go because we know we're going to get a net benefit.

779
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:25,287
Absolutely.

780
01:04:25,307 --> 01:04:29,250
If we wait too long, then we've got Excel that says, well, we've already changed out half of them.

781
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:30,111
What are you going to do now?

782
01:04:30,352 --> 01:04:31,513
And how are you going to do it?

783
01:04:31,593 --> 01:04:34,015
So time might be of the essence.

784
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:34,315
I am.

785
01:04:35,176 --> 01:04:58,646
yes I'm working on it no no I'm just saying and so the question is you had you had said who owns the lights are you talking about the ones that are out there now are you talking about the ones if they get installed ones that are out there right now it's like there's all such ancient history is what's part of what would be the cost if we were to do it though because then when I was told like I think we need to get some firmer estimates but the estimates I've heard $300 to $500

786
01:05:01,587 --> 01:05:29,828
mean but that is what part of that estimate is there is a basically Excel doesn't have to put a monitor how much energy is being used in every single light which would make it prohibitive which would make what make a prohibitive so for us for us yes right and yet you would think the Public Utility Commission would help us out on that so no no no Public Utility Commission has not been helpful whatsoever

787
01:05:31,277 --> 01:05:41,145
The, you know, there's about, you have to take off the ornamental lights, because they're a different animal, and we've got, you know, we've got about, what, 30 of them or something, 25?

788
01:05:41,685 --> 01:05:45,088
Those are the ones up in New, kind of New Bridgewood up there.

789
01:05:45,428 --> 01:05:51,473
Oak Ridge, no, the ornamentals, they're half as high and like three times as expensive.

790
01:05:52,914 --> 01:05:55,136
They're on a pole, they're up by you.

791
01:05:56,603 --> 01:06:21,054
no others yeah there's some up in Kevin's area and there's Oak Ridge couple we installed yeah no yeah that's what happened in the subdivisions time but we have let's just say we have about a hundred lights and I think the price that we were paying was was 15 and I think Bill said the price would go up 15% so we're looking like 18 grand so you're looking at each light being what about 180 bucks a year

792
01:06:23,835 --> 01:06:34,238
So if you say the cost of purchasing it is $300 to $500, and we know the cost of electricity is minimal, it won't take long to pay for them.

793
01:06:34,258 --> 01:06:36,259
At Central College, they replaced all their lights.

794
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:37,319
It's a different situation.

795
01:06:37,379 --> 01:06:40,721
They said their bill's going to go from $18,000 a year to $1,800 a year.

796
01:06:40,741 --> 01:06:44,262
So it's like, but we'll have to, you know, that's something they'll be able to tell.

797
01:06:44,322 --> 01:06:48,323
I think Excel, hopefully they're going to be up front and tell me what's going on.

798
01:06:48,503 --> 01:06:58,550
They said we can actually replace, I talked to actually a contractor from Peoples Electric, and we drove through town, we can replace all those lights on Oak Ridge with LEDs too.

799
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,011
So that's doable.

800
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:05,194
So yeah, I mean if you're talking 180 bucks a light, there's huge incentive.

801
01:07:06,575 --> 01:07:22,387
mean the average something the average those LEDs will last 55,000 hours right and so it's like that's I mean that's the average so we're gonna last longer so I'll ask shorter so let me I'm excited about this I think it's gonna be a great improvement for virtue and save us a lot of money

802
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,942
I think the answer is a political answer more than it's a physical answer.

803
01:07:28,082 --> 01:07:28,562
What can we do?

804
01:07:29,063 --> 01:07:32,004
So the bottom line is, who's going to own them?

805
01:07:32,124 --> 01:07:33,785
Is Excel going to own them, or are we going to own them?

806
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:34,525
We would own them.

807
01:07:34,705 --> 01:07:35,145
We'll own them.

808
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:38,407
If we own them, then they have to put a meter at each one.

809
01:07:38,607 --> 01:07:38,907
We don't know.

810
01:07:38,927 --> 01:07:39,587
That's the question.

811
01:07:39,607 --> 01:07:40,468
That's the question.

812
01:07:40,588 --> 01:07:45,650
But I've heard that they figure out how much it's going to cost, and they just send you a bill.

813
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:50,352
We put a meter on one, then they say, well, this is what it's going to cost for everything.

814
01:07:52,349 --> 01:07:54,470
I mean, that's something I'll figure out with them.

815
01:07:54,650 --> 01:08:02,312
And then they'd be kind of on those lights, which you were mentioning that we would enable them for a future mesh network.

816
01:08:02,652 --> 01:08:03,452
Yeah, that's right.

817
01:08:03,632 --> 01:08:13,735
So down the road, when they put these in, there's actually, if you hate to say it, at the top, a little plug-in where you can actually attach and perhaps Wi-Fi when it becomes feasible.

818
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:15,135
It's like, OK.

819
01:08:15,635 --> 01:08:18,316
These lights that I've talked to, it's like, they're really cool.

820
01:08:18,336 --> 01:08:19,497
I mean, the lights they're putting in,

821
01:08:21,977 --> 01:08:28,399
you can really control how much light goes up and down, almost like a motion detector type of a situation too.

822
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:32,860
So, it'll be exciting to see what kind of technology we'll be able to get for BirdToy.

823
01:08:33,361 --> 01:08:34,181
So, that's cool.

824
01:08:34,821 --> 01:08:35,181
Very cool.

825
01:08:35,461 --> 01:08:35,781
Okay.

826
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:40,543
Other communities have done this, so it's not like we're reinventing the wheel.

827
01:08:41,703 --> 01:08:57,592
know so well it kind of as part of this interestingly came so the we don't really have a right-of-way ordinance here in Birchwood and I was it possible married to have our Planning Commission take a look at this right-of-way ordinance I mean the city the League of Cities has like a 40 a

828
01:09:00,092 --> 01:09:02,273
some page document.

829
01:09:02,293 --> 01:09:07,835
I mean, the right-of-way is like, well, so why do we need a right-of-way ordinance in Birchwood, for example?

830
01:09:09,096 --> 01:09:10,217
CenturyLink wants to come in.

831
01:09:10,277 --> 01:09:14,799
They could decide, we're going to put in poles and just put in poles right next to all the other poles in town.

832
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:20,521
Or we're going to dig something underground and not have to worry about ruining people's yards and things like that.

833
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:26,064
So I think if the Planning Commission just takes a look at it, they've got some short versions or long versions.

834
01:09:27,104 --> 01:09:28,805
If we could ask Alan first.

835
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:29,566
Yes, yeah.

836
01:09:29,746 --> 01:09:37,692
I mean because I don't know why somebody could come in here and start putting things in our easements without permission and I don't know.

837
01:09:38,793 --> 01:09:40,674
Because they're big and they can do it.

838
01:09:40,694 --> 01:09:41,735
I don't know.

839
01:09:41,755 --> 01:09:42,456
But perhaps.

840
01:09:42,476 --> 01:09:43,657
That's happened in the past.

841
01:09:44,377 --> 01:09:44,637
Pardon?

842
01:09:44,858 --> 01:09:46,119
It's never happened in the past.

843
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:46,699
Exactly.

844
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:51,263
I mean, you know, Quest comes in and says, we want to be a franchise, so we need permission.

845
01:09:51,283 --> 01:09:52,884
So everybody seems to ask permission.

846
01:09:54,145 --> 01:09:55,986
But Alan's got to have a good idea.

847
01:09:56,006 --> 01:09:57,087
He's doing the work.

848
01:09:57,127 --> 01:09:58,208
He does it with Maplewood.

849
01:09:58,808 --> 01:10:02,271
And then if Alan gets his two cents, put our planning commission involved.

850
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:02,832
So I'll leave this.

851
01:10:02,852 --> 01:10:05,554
Is Alan coming tomorrow?

852
01:10:07,363 --> 01:10:08,344
We'll put it on for tomorrow.

853
01:10:09,385 --> 01:10:10,906
Kind of segues into all these things together.

854
01:10:10,986 --> 01:10:13,128
CenturyLink is getting closer.

855
01:10:13,588 --> 01:10:14,509
That's all I can say.

856
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:21,874
There's been some, about half the towns that they've been negotiating with have gotten agreements.

857
01:10:21,914 --> 01:10:22,775
The other half haven't.

858
01:10:22,935 --> 01:10:24,416
We're in the other half that hasn't right now.

859
01:10:24,897 --> 01:10:25,417
For?

860
01:10:25,778 --> 01:10:28,780
Getting an agreement, getting a contract with CenturyLink to come into Berkshire.

861
01:10:32,203 --> 01:10:34,544
I'm just Joe Citizen right now, so if you're

862
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:37,674
being solicited by CenturyLink for internet.

863
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:38,999
Is that different?

864
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:41,590
Yes, because they're talking about TV.

865
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:42,671
All right.

866
01:10:43,351 --> 01:10:44,671
That's what they're talking about, cable TV.

867
01:10:44,691 --> 01:10:49,972
So they're going to be able to give you more bundles, because they do internet, and they have more competition, lower prices.

868
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:50,232
That's right.

869
01:10:50,252 --> 01:10:51,132
They do more competition.

870
01:10:51,152 --> 01:10:52,113
That's a theory.

871
01:10:52,293 --> 01:10:54,373
Better service, but we'll have to see.

872
01:10:54,753 --> 01:10:57,394
So got to make sure they jump through all the right hoops.

873
01:10:58,354 --> 01:10:58,894
So that's coming.

874
01:10:58,914 --> 01:11:03,355
As soon as that comes through the Cable Commission, we'll feed it back to the city, City of Berkshire.

875
01:11:03,715 --> 01:11:07,276
Is that their field system, FIIOS?

876
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:07,896
I don't know.

877
01:11:08,036 --> 01:11:08,096
OK.

878
01:11:08,256 --> 01:11:08,676
I don't know.

879
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:27,832
plant sale we had 30 some people here exchanging hundreds of plants that was fun again we'll see us in the fall garage sale there is like about 15 18 garage people selling stuff and giving stuff away so we'll keep on doing it okay I'm done Mike

880
01:11:29,132 --> 01:11:41,070
update on the deer report yes thank you mayor and council last month you asked me just to gather a little bit more information regarding John London eyes

881
01:11:42,797 --> 01:11:45,218
research on the deer population here in Birchwood.

882
01:11:45,638 --> 01:11:51,940
I provided you with a memo in the packet with the information that I'll summarize here.

883
01:11:51,960 --> 01:12:07,804
But I did contact the Department of Agriculture, and you'll see the fee to get roughly 25 deer out of town to bring it down to the seven to nine deer that Birchwood should have is gonna cost in the ballpark of about $8,000.

884
01:12:11,325 --> 01:12:19,954
includes eight scouting visits, three hours each, five control visits, and some hours for some meetings.

885
01:12:20,234 --> 01:12:24,478
And then you'll see the 35 deer option a little bit more.

886
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:34,048
Some of the requirements to do that, you know, it requires another meeting with some public input from the residents.

887
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:40,750
The DNR permit requires that the residents are notified in some manner.

888
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:47,673
So wherever the hunting area would be, like a mailing, kind of like a variance mailing every house within 200 feet.

889
01:12:49,613 --> 01:13:00,037
And then if the city did decide that they wanted to move forward with an option like this, well, we would have to get the permit through the DNR gentleman named Scott Nolan.

890
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:08,612
I was also asked to contact the surrounding communities to see what they were doing for their deer population.

891
01:13:08,632 --> 01:13:16,633
I contacted White Bear Lake, Matamitai, Grant, Willerney, and the township of White Bear Lake.

892
01:13:17,453 --> 01:13:23,775
And as of the end of last week, I've only heard back from White Bear Township, who already partners

893
01:13:25,096 --> 01:13:27,758
with Ramsey County with their efforts in their parks.

894
01:13:29,799 --> 01:13:33,042
But I did not hear back from the other surrounding communities.

895
01:13:33,902 --> 01:13:41,388
But the White Bear Township also lets their residents apply for permits to bowhunt in specific areas.

896
01:13:46,336 --> 01:13:53,446
With that I'll yield to any questions or how would you like me to proceed if any?

897
01:13:54,648 --> 01:13:58,714
I think we need to do more work to get the rest of the communities involved.

898
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:02,760
Whitebird Township and I think I think it'd be nice to

899
01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:10,517
have White Bear Township be inquired about again, because there's no bull hunting on the south side of the lake.

900
01:14:11,138 --> 01:14:13,921
And their parks are on the west side of their township.

901
01:14:13,962 --> 01:14:17,967
So this is a different area that what we do affects them.

902
01:14:18,568 --> 01:14:22,733
And so I think a more full conversation should happen anyway on that issue.

903
01:14:23,397 --> 01:14:36,285
No, yeah, but I did talk to Dale Reed, and he said that the residents in Wiper Township, close to Birchwood, he has not heard any complaints regarding the deer in that part of the neighborhood.

904
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:44,750
All right, so a conversation, though, with White Bear, with Willerney, with Montomedi, with... Grant is too far afield.

905
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,311
I wouldn't spend your time with that.

906
01:14:47,072 --> 01:14:52,295
But those communities... I think especially Montomedi, because that's the pipe that comes right through Kevin's yard,

907
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:20,462
So I I think they need to be involved in a discussion and and Cost-sharing because I thought we were told that the price was $200 per deer and now it's gone up to $300 per deer So I think there needs to be some sort of cost sharing because it's it's a regional issue It's not just us and I we can't solve the issue alone So I agree with that I will

908
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:27,411
get a hold of those communities and have an update for you in July.

909
01:15:29,512 --> 01:15:31,893
Okay, last item then is Wildwood Park.

910
01:15:32,593 --> 01:15:33,954
We've got some issues down there.

911
01:15:34,474 --> 01:15:35,335
They're not getting better.

912
01:15:35,915 --> 01:15:38,396
Mike, do you want to kind of set the table on that?

913
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:47,640
Yes, Wildwood Park, as you, the mayor and council know, and a lot of the residents know, the building site at 232, the

914
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:55,722
Builders have been parking in the park, destroyed the grass.

915
01:15:57,243 --> 01:16:00,305
I've been informed that they will re-sod it.

916
01:16:01,646 --> 01:16:06,749
They're supposed to re-sod it by the end of this week, early next week, and have it finished for the 4th of July.

917
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:12,072
I do have it in writing that the builder has agreed to do that.

918
01:16:14,293 --> 01:16:30,979
but they, even after asking them many times not to park, the way they do, they still continue to do it, and I've had to go down there numerous times to ask them to move their vehicles out of the center of the park, as well as the drainage down there in the drain.

919
01:16:31,139 --> 01:16:40,542
I've had to ask them to clean it out numerous times, and with the large rain we've had the last four days, it's just become an ongoing issue.

920
01:16:41,288 --> 01:16:46,070
So you've given them plenty of warning, so why aren't the police involved now?

921
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:53,573
We'll just have Jack go over and put a hole in the house, a hole in the construction project or something like that then.

922
01:16:53,933 --> 01:16:55,014
Whatever works, I don't know.

923
01:16:55,294 --> 01:16:55,994
He'll be able to do something.

924
01:16:58,675 --> 01:17:04,217
I will start calling the Sheriff's Department if they continue to park.

925
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:05,358
Did they get called today?

926
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,251
I did not call them today.

927
01:17:07,311 --> 01:17:11,075
I personally went down there to the site and asked them to move their vehicles.

928
01:17:11,115 --> 01:17:12,196
And they were there again, right?

929
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:16,300
There was one in the center of the park again today, yes.

930
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:20,244
Mike, I don't think we can do anything to say we're asking.

931
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,498
This is a poor use of your time.

932
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:28,220
It's a very poor use of our time and our resources.

933
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:45,310
This is a park that is a centerpiece of that neighborhood and it's extremely disrespectful that they don't honor that and they don't live here and they don't have the consequences of what they're doing and I don't believe that they'll have it started by the end of the week.

934
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:53,593
I just don't because there's been no proof that they will follow through with anything you've asked them to, and we're now in a mode of telling them.

935
01:17:54,654 --> 01:18:01,177
And Alan's not here tonight, but we need to have, make sure, I don't think we can red tag the house.

936
01:18:01,437 --> 01:18:05,259
I don't think we can, but if we can, I have no problem with that, but I don't think we can.

937
01:18:06,343 --> 01:18:20,153
But we need Alan on board to give these guys an ultimatum about what they need to do and what they must do and what we will do and what it will cost them and how we'll abate the cost.

938
01:18:20,313 --> 01:18:24,717
Because I don't want to go into something where we pay for it and then we try and scratch to get the money back.

939
01:18:25,884 --> 01:18:28,307
So this is a point of no return.

940
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:34,815
They have dishonored us in every sense of the word in keeping that neighborhood appropriate.

941
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:44,486
I was, as I mentioned to you earlier today, I was going by the Piccadilly project in Montemita yesterday, and at the end of the day, they pulled out their gas-powered street cleaner.

942
01:18:45,047 --> 01:18:47,429
handheld one, and they cleaned up the street before they left.

943
01:18:48,069 --> 01:18:59,857
And that's not being done here, and that sediment is now going into our catch basins, and we're paying the money to extract that out of the catch basins at 200 bucks a time, which is, you know, expensive.

944
01:18:59,917 --> 01:19:02,139
The street is like a couple inches deep in mud.

945
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:03,900
There's no excuse.

946
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,321
There's no excuse for this.

947
01:19:06,222 --> 01:19:09,104
And, you know, we happen to have a meeting tonight, so we can bring this to a head.

948
01:19:09,684 --> 01:19:12,867
Had we not, they would continue to misbehave.

949
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:20,133
So I think it needs to be made extremely clear to them, and as a matter of fact, to you.

950
01:19:20,633 --> 01:19:30,855
The cops need to be called, because they know these guys have been given notice not to park, and they've been given it in writing, and the cops need to act on that.

951
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,716
They say, we can't do anything until these people know what they can and can't do.

952
01:19:35,076 --> 01:19:37,096
We also need to have some no parking signs up there.

953
01:19:37,796 --> 01:19:43,237
And I know we've talked about that, and it seems to me we've got to get those up immediately as well.

954
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,860
I thought we had them on order.

955
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:45,701
We have them.

956
01:19:47,441 --> 01:19:48,341
Are they ready to go?

957
01:19:48,361 --> 01:19:52,603
We're pulling the ones out of Ty Schmidt.

958
01:19:52,883 --> 01:19:53,223
Perfect.

959
01:19:53,443 --> 01:19:54,063
Posting everything.

960
01:19:54,343 --> 01:19:54,583
Gone.

961
01:19:54,863 --> 01:19:55,884
That's my two cents.

962
01:19:55,964 --> 01:19:59,585
I don't know how everyone else feels about it, but to me it's gone on too long.

963
01:20:03,546 --> 01:20:04,687
Any other opinions?

964
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:06,247
Ellen's going to be here tomorrow?

965
01:20:06,767 --> 01:20:07,027
Pardon?

966
01:20:07,127 --> 01:20:07,988
Is Ellen going to be here tomorrow?

967
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:09,168
I don't know.

968
01:20:10,102 --> 01:20:14,126
I don't know for sure, but I'll ask him tomorrow.

969
01:20:14,626 --> 01:20:15,788
Might be a conservation meeting.

970
01:20:15,868 --> 01:20:17,349
It's the third Wednesday of the month.

971
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:22,354
I think we should have a pretty robust conversation.

972
01:20:22,374 --> 01:20:29,901
I know someone, Mary or Mike, just talked to Alan saying we need something ready to go now for these guys.

973
01:20:32,433 --> 01:20:34,695
I mean, now, to me, it's like... Now?

974
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:38,938
Well, now they've got a mess with the mud.

975
01:20:39,018 --> 01:20:39,719
I mean, it's rained.

976
01:20:40,379 --> 01:20:43,442
It'll have rained over three inches in the last two days, so it's like, I don't know.

977
01:20:44,002 --> 01:20:46,924
But they drive their trucks as if it's pavement out there.

978
01:20:46,944 --> 01:20:47,445
I know, I know.

979
01:20:47,465 --> 01:20:49,426
And they back up and they roll forward.

980
01:20:49,446 --> 01:20:50,807
I walk by it two or three times a day.

981
01:20:51,288 --> 01:20:52,369
Yeah.

982
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:54,850
I'm surprised there haven't been more complaints.

983
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:59,454
The level of patience has been exceeded in whatever's reasonable.

984
01:20:59,474 --> 01:21:00,535
We're nice people on Wildwood.

985
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:16,265
So, right, I think it needs to be done, and it needs to be done now, and Alan needs to tell us exactly what parameters we have, but I think there's an abatement remedy, and I think there's a time period where we have to act.

986
01:21:18,145 --> 01:21:19,526
So, anyone else?

987
01:21:20,806 --> 01:21:21,266
Make sense?

988
01:21:22,907 --> 01:21:23,167
All right.

989
01:21:24,475 --> 01:21:25,176
See you all tomorrow.

990
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:32,663
So I'm going to suggest that we recess this, and so I need a motion to recess until tomorrow night at what time, Mike?

991
01:21:33,784 --> 01:21:34,084
7 p.m.

992
01:21:34,124 --> 01:21:34,564
tomorrow night.

993
01:21:35,685 --> 01:21:36,246
Make that motion.

994
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:36,967
Is there a second?

995
01:21:37,307 --> 01:21:37,667
Second.

996
01:21:37,928 --> 01:21:38,708
All those in favor?

997
01:21:38,969 --> 01:21:39,089
Aye.

998
01:21:39,189 --> 01:21:39,549
Aye.

999
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:40,330
That carries.

1000
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:41,391
Stand and recess.
